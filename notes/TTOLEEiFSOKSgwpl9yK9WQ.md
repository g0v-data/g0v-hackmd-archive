Challenges of Disinformation in the Era of AI

HOST:Cofacts

## 社群軌介紹：
再不熟悉科技領域的人都可以使用生成式ＡＩ體驗各種資料累積下的預測與衝擊，更有許多人預測生成式ＡＩ將帶來更多的假資訊，而群眾的認知面臨更多的挑戰。在資訊環境中，公民科技社群Cofacts要與來自泰國的Cofact公民科技查核組織還有台灣資訊環境研究中心一起來討論假訊息的各種挑戰與如何透過協作與連結守護我們的資訊環境。

Even those who are not familiar with the field of technology can use generative AI to experience various content predictions and industrial impacts accumulated from data. Many people predict that generative AI will bring more misinformation and disinformation, posing greater challenges to public awareness. In the information environment, the civic tech community Cofacts, together with the Cofact civic tech fact checking organization from Thailand and IORG, will discuss the various challenges of information and how to safeguard our information environment through collaboration and connections.
