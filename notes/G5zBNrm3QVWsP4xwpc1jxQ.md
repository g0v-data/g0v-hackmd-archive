Replaced my front door last summer after years of dealing with drafts and moisture getting through the old wooden frame. Vancouver's rain and humidity really destroys wood doors faster than you'd expect. Started researching [exterior doors vancouver](https://www.elegantentrydoors.ca/vancouver/) options and was surprised by how many materials and styles are available now compared to what I remembered. Find durable exterior doors vancouver at a great price. Went with a fiberglass door in the end and it's been holding up perfectly through the wet season. Installation crew finished everything in about half a day and sealed the frame properly which made a noticeable difference to the temperature inside. Wish I had replaced it sooner honestly
