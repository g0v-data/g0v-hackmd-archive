# Global Comms Content Guidelines


### Purpose of This Document
* Define content that is encouraged to be written on da0 public publications
* Define content that should NOT be written on da0 public publications
* Structuring the process of collection -> feedback/editing -> approval -> publication 
* Empower everyone to write while keeping our content cohesive and mission driven externally

### Mission of Global Comms
* Bridge da0 with global web3 communities to import knowledge, build relationships, and export progress


### Values We Embrace
* Mission aligned and cohesive
* Freedom to express individual opinions
* Insipiration of mutual discussion/conversation
* Stimulation of further action

### Anti-Guidelines 
* NO targetted towards specific age/ethnicity/profession/political preference...etc. Unless proven factual.
* NO endorsement of specific individual/legal entity/prodcut that entails any form of financial advice.

### Types of Writing
* Factual (for da0 event/activity recaps, progress updates, ... etc.)
* Opinionated (for agenda setting, idea/proposal/value sharing,  community reflections,... etc.)

### Factual Writing 
* Tips & reminders
    * Every da0 activity and anything directly related to the da0 community could be of our interest to publish about.
    * Aim to inform, instruct or persuade by giving facts and information.
    * Being descriptive and explainatory. Highly-suggested to write in a third-person point of view.
* Process
    * **Pick-up** or **Propose**
        * All content is supposed to be published in both English and Mandarin. Check out what's waiting to be written or translated on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hRCSRGfA/da0-global-comms).
        * Claim to write/translate by picking up the card(s). Don't forget inform everybody on Slack!
~~You can also purpose an topic/idea by creating a new card and tagging content editor of the month to confirm.~~
    * **Gather feedback**
        * When the writing/translation is finished, share it on Slack and ask/expect for feedback from the others.
    * **Gather Approval**
        * Content to be posted to official blogs (Substack and Matters) must receive 3 “**LGTM**” comments before it gets posted.
    * **Post/Publication** 
        * Once approved, ping content editor of the month to post. On substack, apply to become a writer to get proper credit as the author.
        * Automatically reshare to Twitter if posted.
        * Content editor of the month retains the right to schedule and coordinate every publication. 

### Opinionated Writing
* Tips & Reminders
    * Strongly encourage content to be related to da0 mission and global comms' mission.
    * All must begin with "*All content is expressed as solely personal opinion of author that does not represent da0.*" without exception.
    * First-person narration is fine. As long as any opinions are explicitly expressed as the authors' own opinions within the writing.
    * Free speech still matters! Although no guarantee will be voted/approved to official blog, the [Opinion section](https://da0tw.substack.com/p/da0-0pinion/comments) can fit any content as long as it does not violate our "anti-guidelines" above.
* Process
    * **Submit**
        * Anyone is free to submit content at all times within Slack group.
        * All content is supposed to be published in both English and Mandarin. However, you are welcomed to submit with single language ready only. 
    * **Gather Feedback** 
        * Ask/expect for feedback from the others.
    * **Gather Approval** 
        * For content to be posted to official blogs (Substack and Matters), must receive 3 "**LGTM**" comments. We can democratically decide what gets posted to our official blogs.
    * **Post/Publication** 
        * Once approved, if any translation is needed, create a card on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/hRCSRGfA/da0-global-comms) to hire a translator.
        * As soon as both versions are ready, ping content editor of the month to post. On Substack, apply to become a writer to get proper credit as the author.
        * Automatically reshare to Twitter if posted.
        * Content editor of the month retains the right to schedule and coordinate every publication.
        * For an opinionated piece, if not approved for whatever reason, the author is free to post it to Substack under the [da0 0pinion section](https://da0tw.substack.com/p/da0-0pinion/comments) as a comment.

### Questions 
* How can our content platforms and process support this mission? 
    * Our official content has to fit within the mission otherwise the messaging can be confusing and incohesive for people curious to learn about our progress. 
* What to do for people who want to express their opinions? 
    * Can we have an opinion section or type of article where as long as nothing offensive and random is written, anything goes? 
    * Or should we have a democratic voting process where people can submit anything they want but need minimum amount of votes to be published?
* How might we motivate the wider community to contribute to content production?
    * Bounty hunting - more integration with incentivize-g0v? (e.g. earning non-transferable tokens by writing?)
* Relationship between Substack/Matters and social media channels?
