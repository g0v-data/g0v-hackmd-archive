Welcome back

Digital Democracy has reemerged as a keyword many times since the 1990's, each time meaning something a little different. Some have suggested the term is now too vague to be useful, while others think that the term can help promote discussion of the way that technology can be used to build democratic partiicpation. In this episode, we discuss what the concept means and whether it is a helpful way to frame what the g0v community is doing.
