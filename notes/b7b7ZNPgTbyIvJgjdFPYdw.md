CS2 has completely taken over my gaming time lately! The competitive matches are so intense and I love trying to rank up through the different skill groups. What really surprised me was how much I ended up caring about weapon skins - I thought they were pointless at first but now I'm obsessed with collecting them. There's so much to learn about different rarities, conditions, and market values that I found this comprehensive [info](https://dmarket.com/cs2-wiki/) resource really helpful for understanding everything. My friends think I'm crazy for spending money on digital cosmetics but having unique weapon designs makes every match feel more personal and exciting somehow
