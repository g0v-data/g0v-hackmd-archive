# g0v in France...?

Hi all, 

My name is Theo, I am a student in Lyon, France. I’ve been following the community for some time and have wanted to somehow get involved. With some help from other students here in Lyon I would like to have a go at trying to help get g0v off the ground here in France. 

The idea is in the very early stages, so really any and all ideas are welcome.

The state has quite a big trove of open data to be found at : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/ this could be a good starting off point for any projects. 

As I see it there are a couple of main things we can be doing:
Building projects directly - similar to those built in Taiwan or projects unique to France. 
Building a community in France to get involved in building and collaborating on projects.

If you have any ideas in either of these areas or want to start building something right away please do get involved.  

vTaiwan is also very interesting and the French government has been moving in this direction using technology to allow the public to express their opinion on certain issues. It would be good to create a space for discussion to understand how vTaiwan was implemented in Taiwan and if there would be a way to do a similar thing in France? 

Of course specificity is central to project building so I think it would be a good idea to create a list of ‘burning issues’ in France which would be good candidates for certain projects. 

If you find the idea interesting please feel free to contribute :)
