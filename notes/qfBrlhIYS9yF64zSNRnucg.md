### Here's what I'd like to know:


1\. What is your affiliation with the student group? How do you know them and what drew you to their work?

2\. What was your reaction to the protest crackdown yesterday?

3\. Many Taiwanese are protesting the latest legislation, but the government says it will be good for the economy and boost tourism. Do you think western nations are partly to blame, should they stand up and support Taiwan's freedom fighters, rather than enabling the government with tourist revenue?

4\. What is the students' next move, and how will you take part?

5\. Do you have any photos of earlier student events, and/or images of yourself taking part?

Thanks,
