Rodenticides Market to Reach USD 8.68 Billion by 2031 Driven by Increase in The Number of Rodents, Occurring in Both Urban and Rural Regions

The SNS Insider report estimates the [Rodenticides Market ](https://www.snsinsider.com/reports/rodenticides-market-3554) size was valued at USD 5.53 billion in 2023. It is estimated to hit USD 8.68 billion by 2031 and grow at a CAGR of 5.7% over the forecast period of 2024-2031. 

The market growth is driven by various factors including increased costs associated with pest-related diseases, a surge in rodent populations, growing consumer demand for pest control, and the availability of natural rodenticides. The rise in rodent populations has led to the spread of infectious diseases such as plague, hantavirus infection, and Lassa fever, negatively impacting the environment, wildlife, and human health. Consequently, there's been a heightened demand for rodent control products across industrial, residential, and commercial settings. Rodent control solutions are increasingly sought after in major cities globally, with market players developing new products to effectively manage rodent populations. Anticipated growth in demand is attributed to the proliferation of workplaces, hospitals, hotels, and residences, coupled with a preference for heightened hygiene standards. Natural rodenticides are gaining traction due to their non-toxic nature to humans, pets, and wildlife, as well as their biodegradability. These products offer economic viability, as they require no special handling, storage, transportation, or disposal, further contributing to market expansion.

However, market expansion may be limited by concerns regarding the use of chemical substances and their potential adverse effects on humans and the environment, resulting in stringent legal regulations governing product application.

**Segment Analysis**

The Anticoagulants segment is forecasted to maintain a dominant market share of approximately 35% in 2023. These rodenticides function by disrupting the blood clotting process in rodents, resulting in internal bleeding and eventual mortality. This mechanism proves highly effective against various rodent species, driving widespread adoption among pest management professionals, agricultural producers, and homeowners. A significant advantage of anticoagulant rodenticides is their potent and long-lasting efficacy, ensuring lethality with a single feeding over multiple days. This feature makes them well-suited for managing rodent infestations across diverse environments, including residential, commercial, and agricultural settings. Additionally, anticoagulant rodenticides are available in various formulations such as baits, pellets, and blocks, offering flexibility in application methods to address specific pest control needs.  Furthermore, anticoagulant rodenticides are preferred for their relatively low risk of secondary poisoning to non-target animals, including pets and wildlife, compared to other rodenticide types.

**Competitive Insights**

The rodenticides market exhibits a highly fragmented structure, comprising numerous prominent, large-scale companies alongside regional and small-scale players. Regional market players are expanding their businesses due to the increasing use of these products in controlling post-harvest grain damage, as well as in buildings and electronics protection. Meanwhile, major market players are actively pursuing strategies to enhance their global market share. These strategies include engaging in mergers and acquisitions, launching new products, and collaborating with governments to raise awareness about available products and their benefits.

For instance, in January 2022, Syngenta Crop Protection completed the acquisition of NemaTrident and UniSpore, two bioinsecticides developed by Biomema Ltd., a renowned leader in bioprotection technology.

**Impact of Russia and Ukraine-War on Rodenticides Market**

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has disrupted the rodenticide supply chain, causing shortages and production delays, leading to higher prices and limited availability in affected regions. Manufacturers heavily reliant on supplies from these countries struggle to meet market demands. Additionally, the conflict has shifted demand patterns for rodenticides.

Russia and Ukraine are significant contributors to global wheat production, with Russia being the largest wheat exporter and Ukraine the fifth largest. Their role in supplying wheat to regions like the Middle East and North Africa, where it is a staple food, is crucial. However, disruptions in agricultural activities due to the conflict have reduced the need for rodenticides in farming communities. Conversely, urban areas with displaced populations have seen an increase in rodent infestations, driving up demand for rodenticide products.

**Regional Analysis**

Asia Pacific is poised to experience rapid growth in the forecast period for several reasons. Agriculture is a key revenue-generating sector in major economies like China and India, driven by the region's burgeoning population, which demands increased food production. However, crop damage and food loss due to rodent infestation remain significant challenges. For instance, according to the Indian Ministry of Consumer Affairs, approximately 57,676 metric tons of food grains stored in Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns were spoiled by rodents and pests, as well as exposure to rain and floods. Inexpensive, effective, and user-friendly rodenticide products offer practical solutions for rodent control in many emerging countries across the Asia Pacific region.

**Key Takeaways:**

- The global rodenticides market is poised for significant growth fueled by rising air travel demand, particularly in emerging economies.

- Strategic alliances, investments, cooperative ventures, product introductions, and advancements among companies play a pivotal role in securing essential components, expertise, and market positioning.

- The anticoagulant rodenticides dominated the revenue share of the rodenticide market.
