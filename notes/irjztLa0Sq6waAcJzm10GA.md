# **Difference Between @mixin and @extends in SASS and SCSS**

**@mixin**

**Definition: @mixin allow you to create a style that can be reused throughout your style sheet. You can pass parameter to @mixin and add the required value when you are calling it, Mixins are included into the current context using the @include at-rule, which is written as @include <name> or @include <name>(<arguments...>), with the name of the mixin being included.**

Example:
```
