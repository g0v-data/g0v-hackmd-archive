# Slide 1: Introduction (2 minutes) *Vee*
**Definition of AI:**
* AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to machines and computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, making decisions, and even solving problems. AI is essentially a way to simulate human cognitive abilities in machines, allowing them to perform functions with varying levels of autonomy.
* These neural networks or algorythms are programmed to analyse and learn from a given set of data. 
* Ai is capable of computing vast amounts of data with incredible percision to generate a requested response. 
* it is heavily dependent on the proccessing power provided to it!
*  It's speed, accuracy and overall capacity for computing relies on the amount of data it has access to and the compound processing capacity given to it 
    * i.e. the amount of requests/units of information it can process per unit time
    
**Scope of the Presentation:** *Overview of how AI impacts skilled labor across various industries -> describe how ai impacts skilled labour, it's consequences, potential benefits and disadvantages.*

# Slide 2: The evolution of labor (2 minutes) *Vee*
•	Evolution of Labor: From manual labor to skilled professions.
•	Past Technological Revolutions: Brief mention of previous disruptions (e.g., industrial revolution, automation).

Long before the emergence of the modern human, labour had been an essential part of survival among large groups of ancient hunting-gathering primates. 
It is a general trend that in nature, animals with socially-oriented behaviours are largely more successful than those who lead solitary lives. Bees and ants are brilliant examples of this: every member of a hive or colony lives for the benefit of the group, which makes survival of every individual non-essential, prioritising efficiency and sustenance of the collective and it's growth. However, primates as ourselves, are far more complex organisms, capable of far more complex operations.

As early human groups expanded and developed new methods for acquiring resources, the division and organization of labor naturally emerged, forming the beginnings of social structures. This marked the start of a deep link between work and social organization, which continues today.

For most of human history, labor was primarily physical and focused on tasks like crafting tools and gathering resources. But as these early communities grew, the need for organized labor increased, leading to the emergence of administrative roles — a more abstract form of labor. 

Before the 18th century, early business activities were largely based on local trade and the exchange of goods or services. Businesses were small-scale and often family-owned.
The next major shift occurred with the Industrial Revolution in recent centuries, which transformed labor by shifting physical tasks from humans to machines. The rise of factories and mass production led to the growth of large-scale corporations. As a result, intellectual work began to dominate, fueled by advances in energy production, transportation, technology, and science.

At present, human society favours intellectual labour over physical almost in it's entirety. Additionally, businesses are adapting to the digital age that we live in, with a focus on automation, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. So now even the position of overseeing machines and making executive decisions and calculations is being automated through AI. 



# Slide 3: AI Technologies Impacting Skilled Labor (3 minutes) *Vee*
•	Machine Learning: How algorithms analyze data and make decisions.
•	Robotics: Automation in manufacturing, surgery, etc.
•	Natural Language Processing: Chatbots, content generation, etc.


- machinery had begun aiding and replacing people in direct manual work ever since the industrial evolution
- explanation: consistency and efficiency with which machines are able to operate 
-  This tendency saw a drastic expansion at the start of the 21st century (the third industrial revolution), with the creation of the internet and worldwde-scale digitalisation and globalisation of trade creating an ever-increasing demand for mass-production. However, most of the machinery actively involved in labor, to this day, requires a human operator or supervisor, with applicable qualifications depending on the given field. However, with the rise of ai human involvement in machine operation may eventually become obsolete, outside of monitoring and occasional repairs. But what exactly enables ai to partially or completely replace a human operator? 


Until fairly recently, the possibility of ai replacing people entirely has been absolutely inconceivable, due to the many limitations of an algorythm-based ai, which is only capable of following pre-programmed pathways, give out pre-made answers or follow an already existing sequence. 
However, within the last decade a new kind of ai has emerged: neuralnetworks. Neuralnetworks are ai programs that seek to immitate the function of the human brain, through extensive chains of "neurons", or "nodes" that guide it's decision-making process. In it's core, this kind of program, too, is an algorythm, however it's main focus is pattern recognition and matching a prompt that it is given with similiarities recorded within it's database. Because of this, programs based on this principle require massive amounts of data in order to function well, or at all, however, as mentioned prior another vital component to their operation is processing power - which enables them to actually do the calculation and recognize certain patterns. 
Note, that ai DOES NOT CREATE anything new when giving a response, it is only able to utilise what is contained within it's database!
Because of this, one may compare, for example, a chatbot, to an advanced search-engine, that compiles what it is able to find in it's memory and puts it into a response it deems best/most accurate to what is requested. 


~~When it comes to automation, these bots, called "language models", definitely posses a degree of relevance. The limited capacity to imitate learning enables large languagemodels to be incredibly flexible when it comes to managing machinery, as an example in case of a malfunction, the ai can detect it, reference a previously recorded case of a similiar hinderance and in accordance with the results find a way to handle the situation until intervention is possible. One can also think of usage in information search: such as searching an expansive reserve of medical knowledge for specific facts, or enabling automated customer support in cases where the request is not complex or unexampled. 
It is also worth to note that given the capacity for flawless calculation and ability to strictly follow a set command, means that a well-built languagemodel can complete complex calculations or tasks involving copius amounts of numbers under different categories.

    * mining for natural resourcers, gathering of crops, logging, etc.
* calculation and data storage aspects of many administrative positions(e.g. finance, accounting) 
* healthcare 
    * medical databases, surgical robots, various diagnostic devices

# Slide 5: Benefits of AI Integration (3 minutes) *Ana*
•	Increased Efficiency: Faster production and decision-making.
•	Cost Reduction: Lower labor costs and increased profitability.
•	Improved Accuracy: Reduced human error in complex tasks.

All and all, modern ai programs can be repurposed to be effective in almost any field of work that needs a set pattern of actions to be completed well, it is also associated with far less labor costs, minimal mistakes(if the program and the information it is given is well optimized for a specific task) and swiftness in completion of tasks that is incoprabable to that of human beings 

# Slide 6: Challenges and Concerns (3 minutes) *Ana*
•	Job Displacement: Specific examples of jobs at risk.
•	Skill Gaps: Need for new skills in the workforce.
•	Ethical Considerations: Bias in AI systems and decision-making.




# Slide 7: Statistics (3 minutes) *Ana + Vee*
The expected evolvement of the workforce in the future:
* **Since 2000**, automation has already resulted in 1.7 million manufacturing jobs being lost (BuiltIn)
* professions most likely to lose their jobs to AI (WEF): 
    1. Data entry clerks
    3. Administrative secretaries
    4. Accounting
* so far, 23.5% of US companies have replaced workers with ChatGPT (Resume Builder)
* about 2 Million manufacturing workers will be replaced **by 2025**, most of the jobs by robots but some by AI tools that we don't even know yet (according to: MIT/Boston University)
* over 7.5 million data entry jobs will be lost **by 2027** (WEF)
* 14% of the global workforce (375 million people) will be forced to change their career **by 2030** (McKinsey)
    * this study did not yet consider AGI (Artificial Generated Intelligence) and needs to be updated
* over 300 million jobs might be replaced by AI entirely (Goldman Sachs via BBC)
    * that would be the equivalent of 1/4 of the work tasks in Europe and the US
    * examples of professions that will probably face lower wages due to the competition that AGI-models create
        * journalists
        * writers
        * photographers
        * software developers
        * uber driver

Practically every job involves some tasks that are vulnerable to being automated by Al. Only a small minority of workers are totally unexposed to Al (ARXIV).

4. Security Risks
Hacking: AI systems can be targets for cyberattacks. If hackers attack AI in places like banks or hospitals, it could cause big problems.
Privacy Concerns: AI needs a lot of personal data to work, and if that data isn’t protected well, it could lead to privacy issues.
5. Loss of Human Touch
Less Personal Interaction: In areas like customer service or healthcare, people might miss the personal connection that comes with talking to a real human instead of a machine.
Relying Too Much on AI: If we depend too much on AI, people might lose important skills or make poor decisions when AI isn’t available.
6. Need for Rules
Few Regulations: Right now, there aren’t many clear rules about how AI should be used in important areas like healthcare or finance. This can lead to unfair or unsafe practices.




look at the future of AI replacing skilled jobs:

1. More Jobs Done by AI
AI in Many Areas: In the future, more jobs will be done by AI. Factories, customer service, and even driving will rely more on robots and AI instead of people.
AI in New Fields: AI will also start doing jobs in education, law, and creative areas like art or writing, taking over tasks that need skill.
2. New Jobs Will Appear
Different Jobs: While AI will replace some jobs, it will create new ones that involve building, fixing, and improving AI systems.
Learning New Skills: People will need to learn new skills to get these new jobs. Skills like creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence will be more important because AI isn’t good at those things yet.
3. Better Efficiency
Faster and Smarter Work: Businesses will be able to get more work done because AI can handle the boring, repetitive tasks. This could lead to new ideas and products as people focus on more creative work.
New Industries: AI might even create new industries and job opportunities that don’t exist yet.
4. Risk of Job Loss and Inequality
Bigger Wealth Gap: There’s a risk that AI will make rich people even richer, while some workers lose their jobs and struggle to find new work.
Some Countries Might Fall Behind: Countries that don’t invest in AI technology might struggle economically compared to those that do.
5. Need for Better Rules
More Regulations: As AI becomes more important, there will need to be stronger rules to make sure it’s used safely and fairly. Governments and businesses will need to help workers who lose their jobs by offering training for new careers.
Working with AI: The future will likely involve humans working together with AI, with AI doing routine tasks and people making important decisions and solving problems.
6. Unpredictable Changes
Unexpected Impact: We don’t know exactly how AI will change jobs in the future. Some industries will adjust better than others, and new technologies may create unexpected changes in the way we work.
