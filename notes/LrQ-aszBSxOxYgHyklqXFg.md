R: Hello!

T: ok it's on air!  right now. Hello Rajib. Hi.
R: Hello.

T: So, Say hi to Taiwan and tell us about yourself please.
R: ok hello, Taiwan, I am a social researcher, and also a part-time business(?) lecturer at a ... university. And I work in so many social innovative ideas and other works.

T: That's good. So we're very excited to have you here.
R: Thank you so much, I'm also excited to be there, to meet with other people, listen to them, and also share some ideas. ...

T: What do you do before and how did you get into the civic tech field?
R: Actually, I was involved in some social research projects, and also teaching field, so I met a lot of people in Nepal, like this was very exciting, the people, I travel, I met them. During those meeting, like listening to them, I heard so many problems. And the problem has to do the government service, like providing mechanisms that trigger my mind, and ideally I wanted to support to solve their day-to-day problem of accessing the government public services. And so that the eager to help people in solving problem, was one cause lead and attracted me to civic tech field.  And also I met some of my friends, like ..., they are from technical field. And we discuss a lot how we can help the people to access the services from the government offices. Then we found GaliGali, ... edition.

At the beginning, it was like working to map the streets. And the "GaliGali" word in Nepali means the "streets", the "neighborhood". So the beginning idea was to map the streets, and create some digital maps of Kathmandu. Because online you can't find reliable maps. But we couldn't do so. Because of so many problems. Then we ... like our end to support the people in accessing the government's ... side. So that we can help democracy. It's like building a foundation(?), creating knowledge ... and distributing the knowledge to open source, that people can get access to information. And that can sustain, and they can help to bridge the gap of citizen and the state. So we are ... that will eventually help to .... democracy. Also promote open culture and ..... using the technology.

T: That's great!  So is the global civic tech community actually bring impact to you, on your opinion?
R: Yeah, it's obvious. Because so far the technology now will be coming closer to the general people. Now, no more that the technology is with the technicians, now even the common people, they are getting benefits out of it. Because now they can contribute, by providing information, and open source the ... crowdsourcing ... platform, they can participated in it, and also they can use the information to it. So I see like lot of impacts. And even if we observe the last 10 years, in Nepal, like the mobile penetration rate is so high. In 2007 and 2006, now in 2016, we have like almost 50% mobile penetration rate. That means almost all of them have access to internet, GPRS mobile internet, so they can get access to technology, and also they can use the information.

So I think now, this global civic tech community, because of this people are all... we can help to solve the daily problem. Even the small problem they can solve using civic technology.

T: What sessions in g0v summit sounds more interesting to you? Did you see the agenda we publish?
R: Yeah, I saw a lot of interesting agendas. And I saw there are some people from Myanmar, they are sharing about using civic technology in their election campaign and democracy. I also saw that will tell about ...maybe ... China ..about how they are .... cloud ... supervision ...... So I'm interested to hear all these people who are using civic technology in different fields. And also more interesting, I'm eager to know like what are the challenges they are facing in their side(?), because we are also facing some difficult problems(?) here, so I also want to know like ... there are sessions which tells about how they are tackling the problems. I think that would be very interesting for me ...that will leave us some ways of how they are dealing with issues and problems, that we can try here. ... from different ..., like China, Taiwan, Myanmar, ...

T: Okay! So that's it. Thank you for the interview. And we are looking forward to have you here.
R: It's my pleasure to talk with you and also thank you for arranging the meeting. It's very good to interact with you.  I'm so excited because I'm exploring so many ideas.

Hello Liz!
Hi clkao!

So we're very exciting about you coming to the g0v Summit in May. Could you give us a brief introduction about yourself and Public Laboratory?

Sure, um, well, my name is Liz Barry. I'm also extremely excited to be coming to the g0v Summit. I work with a large open source community called the Public Laboratory for open technology and science. And I also work with other types of environmental data production like TreeKit, which is just work with the city of New York to survey all of the urban street trees here. Something that thousands of people participated in, to create high quality data that now, the governments and the citizens can use to collaborate.

Most of my work, though, is with the Public Laboratory for open technology and science. And we are tackling as a community, many different types of environmental investigations. I think the really special thing about the PublicLab community is that, it's a place where people who have different sorts of expertise, can interact with each other, in a conversational pleasant environment and we actually learn from each other. We are understanding what policies are in place to manage the environment. We're looking into what is the techno-science that these policies are based on. And we actually have many people in our community doing hardware development on making research equipment so that people can conduct their own environmental investigations.

That sounds awesome. So, like how many people are participating in Public Laboratory, like the online community for environmental monitoring discussion?

It's hard to count. But there seem to be about 10,000 people involved here now. We don't hear from them all the time, and it's something we're trying to understand right now. There's a ...Among all these people, there's a community leadership group called the organizers. And there people they decided themselves that they wanted to become more active. And I think the distribution of there eighty people around world is maybe a better representation of our diversity.

Well, that sounds like a huge crowd also an awesome thing. What's the most import impact the the PublicLab and the whole community has brought?

It seems like there's a few way to answer that question. As with any large group of people where there's a lot of projects, we're having a number of different kind of impacts. The data collected by our tools primarily our aerial mapping tools, using just plain old cameras, to take aerial photos, in visible or infrared and stitch them into maps. It seems like that kind of photographic evidence is able to have the most impact and in the courts and the media, and in just communicating with policymakers. We're working on a number of other tools ranging from ==particulate matter sensing(?)== to spectroscopy to identify different type of oil. And it's not just the hardware development that's required to get these tools to work but also understanding where into the government system and environment management, regulation and enforcement can that data be heard.

So I think broadly going into what it really takes to manage the environment collaboratively between citizens and government, that's a bit impact of us overall. I would also say, and I'll probably guilty a little bit to bring this point up because it's something I'm personally interested in, something I've been working on since very early days of PublicLab getting together. But, I'm very interested in how the social practices that have evolved on the internet to support the kind of massive collaborative projects like we see in open source software and knowledge production like in Wikipedia.

How to we take the range and the innovative capacity of this commons-based peer production, and use it with other well-known offline forms of social organization that are also known to generate huge social and political outcomes. So in the western hemisphere, we are talking about community organizing, community development corporations, building networks and stakeholders, grass-root campaigns, popular education movements. And in PublicLab, it's very interesting how our online and offline components work together. We have the online social practices that works xxx you know, that you would really recognize from many other open source movements. And then you see people going out and doing research and and building local campaigns, in a way that you would recognize from traditional grass-root political organizing.

So I'm very interested in that combination. And that's one of the real reasons that I'm excited to come to the g0v Summit. I had a opportunity over the past over years, to build more collaboration with people in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. And it has been a non-stop learning experience for me. And I'm really excited to connect with different civil sector movements in Asia. Because I think, you know, the Public Laboratory has been primary western hemisphere, and just in January, actually just a couple of weeks ago, we got our first mainland-China-based organizer, who I'm really excited ....that she's gonna be coming to the g0v Summit as well.So I just think there's a huge opportunity for cultural exchange, for people working in this space.

Can you tell us a bit more about the new collaboration are doing with the teams in China, what have they achieved and how are organizing work there?

There are a lot of incredible environmental activists in China, I just fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet a couple of them. I first met ... I first began to connect with the activists two years ago, in January 2014, during the mad "Making a Difference" conference in Hong Kong. And at that time I met Greenovation Hub, and Hershan(?) who introduced herself by saying, "Oh, hi! I've heard Public Laboratory, and also we have undertaken a very small citizen science project."

Well, she's very modest come to find out that they had designed, manufactured and distributed over 1,000 pH testing kits. And held a public event along a very long river where people were sampling and uploading water quality data to a website that they also built. And at the same time they were collecting oral histories from the older generation who remember the rivers before the factories came.

So this is what they were already doing, and if it's not obvious, let me say it, that is one of - although they disregard(?) it as a small project - that's actually one of the largest citizen science water quality events in the world. And I'm so glad that they are getting more well-known for this.

We have built a collaborative relationship over the last couple of years. And I was able to actually travel with them around some of the industrial pharmaceutical manufacturing sites, that they are watching along with environmental journalists. Just now in January, we also travel to World Villages, where they are moving beyond research into a mediation, to try to deal with some drinking water issues. So this opportunity for me to be able to travel with an engineer, working on water filtration, a product designer, a photo journalist, and two civil sector environmental activists from two different provinces, 廣州, and xxx.

This was really incredible. And we actually speak almost everyday on WeChat, and there's a lot of projects and works, to try to bring the kind of like well-cost(?) and horizontal innovation around actually crating new tools, that PublicLab is kind of known for, but bringing it into Chinese context.

So it seems like you kind of absorb these existing efforts, and the amazing citizen science projects already there, into the broader Public Laboratory community.

Well, "absorb" makes me feel worried, like, we are like some kind of blob(?), like blobbing(?) over everybody. Very ... it's really not the case. We are network(?). We have a lot of organizations that are there doing their own work in a big way. And then when it make sense, that some of their projects are around developing their own environmental research equipments, or going out and doing researches in public and using the data for advocacy --- in those places of overlap, yes, PublicLab will work together with that organization. But we're stronger as a network versus becoming singular "thing".

Cool. So you mentioned that there are like policy makers involved in the PublicLab community as well. So has there been policy change, that is sort of caused by some citizen science efforts and discovered that we should have more or less regulation on certain things, like that stuff?

I did not believe that we have caused a policy change, that I know of, but we have contributed our data into established government processes, and changed the outcome. And by that, I can share one notable example from my home town, New York city, where local researchers, home-owners who lived near a polluted industrial canal, that was once a tilted wetlands. They found themselves all of a sudden getting a lot of attention, because while this industrial canal and its famous pollution had been mostly managed locally by a city-level environmental organization - you know, our department of environmental protection - it was designated, all of a sudden, this site was designated as a federal pollution site, which under United States law has a term called "super fund", meaning that all the industries who had polluted over time were going to be call upon to pay for cleaning it up. "Super fund", fund made out of many many contributors.

So now, we have, you know, some people in Brooklyn who are finding that the federal government is doing research on their backyards essentially. And they said, "well, we live here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, we know which basements are flooding with ground water, we remember what was here before these buildings were built." And the local neighborhood began a long-term many year(?) process of aerial mapping, and going out and conduce to actually check what was going on.

It's a great example of collaboration because the locals were able to actually add and correct in some cases, the environmental assessment maps, that the contracted companies had produced, for the study. And by taking images over time, again and again, and even during a famous, like kind of a "double pollution" event, after a hurricane, our sewage plants were down. And all the sewage neutrons(?) are running into the water, and the bacteria were just growing and dying so fast the water has turn opaque white, with a xxx(?) of bacteria.

The locals actually said, "hey, this is a great opportunity to actually show where there's fresh water still flowing into this polluted water body.", something that the EPA and their corporate contractors had not actually identified. And, so, long story short, two kinds of citizen science came together, which is aerial mapping - which is, you know, a very small scale data, but taken at just the right time - combined with water sampling to actually test the bacterial counts.

Both of those types of citizen collected data together, created enough evidence that the EPA investigated it and found a stream that was very under the land field(?). And because of this, a whole additional city block of titled wetlands is going to be added to the restriction boundary, in the middle of New York city.

That was a bit of long story. So thanks for listening for that. But in this way we'd say, we didn't change the policy, but the citizen data was an effective way for locals to go beyond complaining, to go beyond talking, to enter in discussion on a ==level plan field?== when the age of data, by bring high quality, small and local data, into, like government management processes. That could be a really effective way for citizen's voice to be heard.

So you also mentioned that you're also interested in those, like, the peer-to-peer collaboration, like Wikipedia model and this whole new citizen science, this kind of ways of collaboration. Where do you see this go next? What can this achieve? What would this make well with that?

This is a really exciting time as science itself is democratizing. And it's interesting, it's like peer production means peer review. I think there are some, there have been some tensions, with the institution of science, as compared with grass-root science, but more and more we are building those bridges. The low cost open source tools that are coming out of this peer-to-peer collaborations, are being used by institutional science and institutional scientist. So that part is fine. But I think the next frontier is that, you know, we're gonna see the same standards like data transparency and open research publishing, not just the results, but the models of how you got the results. .... like the spirits of openness actually infuse the original, .. you know, what the institution of science has evolved into.

I think all of this is gonna have an impact on how the environment is managed. And I know a lot of my examples are United States based and I apologize for that. But it's where this particular project starting, so let's see if we can apply it more widely. What we're learning here though, is that, you know, in some cases, the only data that's acceptable for, you know, bringing down regulation, for like invoking government action, has to be collected by certain patented of technology.

Okay, these technologies are patented, how are you ever gonna take advantage of the fact that there are citizens living all over the environment, who are observing important things that the government actually wants to regulate on. But the equipment costs tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the technical details like how it can be made, are completely obscure from public knowledge. So if we talk about this, you know, the kind of being inspired by peer-to-peer collaborations, we can even start looking at how, science is funded to do what, and can we also ask for, you know, publishing and open access journals, can we say, "all right, the government money is going to science and technology, isn't it to be patented and for those companies to get additional money to manufacture and produce technology only they can use?" No, government money should go to create to establish design standards, reference designs, that many many tools can be built up of, all of which can be understood in terms of how they work the data quality they produce. And in that way, we are hoping to have policy impact.

So, I suppose you see the draft agenda of g0v Summit, is there any particular sessions that sounds most interesting to you, those you want to attend?

Yes, actually one of them is scheduled the exact same time as mine is. Well, it's the one "government x civil society x internet x deliberation", it's called "observation and reflection of a mediator". This is critical. I mean, you heard my interest in, like, many types of people of different kinds of expertise can actually come together and share and cross their silos. And there's amazing projects government, there's amazing projects happening in civil sectors, there's amazing projects happening in the private sectors. Where these all come together - and I see that section is run by someone who works as a mediator - is really critical.

And in general, I'm interested in all the sessions that where I can meet people who are working in their countries in their regions, about how the social organization work where they are from. Like, what have been previous traditional models of social organizing. And in their area, is that meeting this new internet enable collaboration. That's what I'm most fascinated in.

Yeah, we have a full track for that, different stories from countries' experiences. Like making NGO using new technologies, how this transformation happening. So yeah! We look forward to seeing you in May!

Great! Thank you so much for having me. I'm really excited and also to see my Chinese collaborators again form Greenovation Hub.

Well, see you soon, bye!

Thank you!

The majority of people have an idea about what they want to do add values - whether that's exposing the voting information of this politician, or showing what they are doing in their local communities, or whatever they want to use to add value. - And they can't do that.

Because they spend half long is getting a data from a source, clearing it up, putting it into a kind of format they can use easily, and then exposing it. And by that point, they've usually lost the will to actually do the valuing part of it.

多數人會想到「可以增加政治資料價值」的點子：不管是像「公開政治人物投票紀錄」、或是「政治人物在地方做了什麼事情」⋯⋯ 等等，他們卻沒辦法做到。

因為他們把大部份的時間花在：取得資料、清理資料、把資料整理成容易使用的格式、然後才能去揭露這些資料。而往往到了這個時候，他們已經喪失了去做一開始的「增加價值」點子的動力了。

4:15 - 4:40
We thought the best way to show people how they could help, was actually do some of it ourselves.

What we did was we kind of switched to asking people, rather then "ok, come and write a script for us and scrape this website for us" which then them would have to keep up to date. What we said was "can you point to us what, where the data is?" ...

4:52-4:55
... So that people don't have to worried about, "Oh, god, I need to keep maintaining the script"

我們認為讓其他人加入幫忙的最好方式是：我們實際上動手去做一些。
例如，相較於跟人們說「來幫忙寫點程式，把網站的資料爬下來吧！」這也往往代表他們必須負責維持並更新資料，我們改成說「你可以告訴我們資料在哪嗎？」
...
這樣人們就不必擔心，「天哪，我得繼續維護這個爬蟲程式」

And this is not just like spreading the message of our movement like podemos, is more about making policy in a direct way. So, direct democracy but with new tools, internet tools, with people creating a policy, creating the proposals, the documents, the laws, and finally approved by the people.

而這不只是想傳播運動的訊息（像 podemos），而是關於直接制定政策。一個利用新工具、利用網路工具的直接民主：每個人都可以提案、發表文件、提出新的法律⋯⋯等等，然後最後經由人民同意而制定。

### 10:02-10:30

So making decision by this kind of processes and tools. So, like having a directive democracy, with people liberate think and change their opinion. They spread their opinions and proposals on the internet. It starts to begin, like a collective intelligence which we gain finally a policy-making in the government.
利用這些（新的）流程和工具來做決策。擁有一個直接民主，人們可以解放思想、改變意見。{ 並且，因為人們透過網路傳播意見和提案，這也會漸漸的形成集體智慧，並最終讓政策在政府體制中被制定。} =\> 不是很確定

Y: okay, yes

C: hello Yago
Y, T: hello
C: this is CL and Ttcat on the video.  we are doing a short video for you to help people decide if they want to come to your session, which they won't have to, because it is, well, an obvious choice. so can you give a brief introduction about yourself and about podemos?  and you involvement in podemos and all these?
Y: well la podemos is a collective where we try to discover new tools to make new processes of democratic participation.  so we really love big organizations with big facebook account with many facebook users, because that's a starting point to spread the use of this kind of tool, they are ... tools so people make content, people decide things, and people make contents that suits them.  so in la podemos we try investigate with these tools, how to use them, and then we try to experiement with these tools.
C: and what about the relationship between la podemos and podemos?
Y: yes, so in la podemos we have been searching different organizations and many people already knew about la podemos when podemos was founded like 1 year ago.  no, 2 years because time moves so fast i can't remember.  but yes when podemos was founded and many people then knew already la podemos and they collects because they want to experiment with a little bit with new tools because they were used to social media like facebook and twitter but they want to know about an architecture of participation so they connect us and we start to experiment some time. yes it was a year ago.  it's so fast.  no i can't believe because one year ago podemos was founded and this summer. wait is it this summer?
C: yes, so we know that it's kind of amazing because podemos got like 20% votes in the last general election, and there is another party c in spain that got like 13% percents of vote.
