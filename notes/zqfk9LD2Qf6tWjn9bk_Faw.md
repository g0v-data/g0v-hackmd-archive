Taiwan, a democratic country who elect its own president and congress, is currently under intensive debate on whether to recognize same-sex marriage, and has received attention of international media. The legislative process, i.e. the amendment of the Taiwanese Civil Code, which had previously received cross-party support and the support of the majority of the citizens according to a poll done in 2013, is now under strong pressure from not only pro-LGBT activists, but also conservative religeous groups. On Decenber third, some 100,000 people rallied on Ketagalan Blvd. in Taipei, Taiwan, protesting against the legislation, and demanding the preservation of "traditional values".

The assembly on Human Rights Day in Taiwan will be echoed world-wide by Taiwanese people in the same weekend in 28 different cities in the US, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, UK, Switzerland, Norway, Japan, Australia, and Thailand.
