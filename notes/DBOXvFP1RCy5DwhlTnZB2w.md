**Build civic tech from grass-roots citizens to monitor government**

Brainstorming:
Build civic tech from grass-roots citizens to monitor government
Build civic tech from grass-roots citizens not government
Build civic tech from grass-roots CSO and open source community instead of government


## Session description
> Max 130 words

Civic tech should empower citizens to monitor the governments.

Disfactory is a crowdsourcing reporting platform on illegal factories on farmlands in Taiwan, co-developed by g0v civic tech communities and an environmental advocacy CSO.

In the talk, we will share how we drive 1) open collaboration momentum and culture integration of floating open source community participants and an organized CSO with intense advocacy agenda and 2) empower CSO’s digital transformation civic tech community to design digital solutions embedded in advocacy, but also how we struggle 3) to outreach and engage more rural users on the ground as an urban-based product team and 4) to raise public awareness under shadows of COVID-19.


## Track

- [ ] Design + Delivery => how we design and prototyping. **human-centered design to product management**
- [ ] Civic innovation + Data => we can focus on the crowd-sourcing model
- [x] Operation + Managements => Collaboration model between g0v community and CET?
- [ ] Technology + Policy

**Design + Delivery**

==From introducing attendees to human-centered design to product management, from user research to managing products that focus on outcomes,== this track will concentrate on how teams design and deliver government services.


**Civic Innovation + Data**

Civic Innovation is where government and technology come together for a more just and equitable society. Where we learn how smart, new uses of technology (but not necessarily new technology!) supports deep, authentic relationships between government and the people. Where promises meet reality and where we focus on ==cities and grass-roots involvement.==

We’ll also focus on data: from ethics to privacy, from putting out fires to building for the future, from the practicalities of sharing across silos to clearly communicating how and why data is being used.


**Operations + Management**

Our Operations + Management track focuses on the processes, practices and people that help us be more effective. What’s working across procurement, project management, oversight and governance? Security and compliance? ==What have we learned about culture, development and hiring? And underscoring all of this, how will we change sustainably, without burning out?==


**Technology + Policy**

The Technology + Policy track explores how researchers, designers, and technologists working with policy and program managers reduces the risk of implementations that check the requirements of policy, but don’t deliver intended policy outcomes. We’ll cover what leaders need to know and how effective collaboration happens, how delivery-driven policy applies to existing programs, and the hot and up-and-coming technology issues policy and program managers need to know about.
