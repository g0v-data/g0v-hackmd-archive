 **(2) Abstract Algebra**
\-  Algebra is a study of basic mathematical structure, e.g. **Group, Ring, Field**.
\- Linear Algebra studies one of the structure called ++**"vector space"**++.
\- Followed by logical deduction from basic definitions, we can derive some important theorems.

**(3) Applied Mathematics**
\- Linear Algebra is widely used in applied science.
\- Like mechanics, differential equation. (ODE, PDE)
\- Recently, it's widely applied to ++Image Processing++ and ++Computer Graphics++, etc.

# Introduction
The central problem of linear Algebra is the solution of linear equation. The most important and simplest case is when ++the number of unknowns++ equals ++the number of equation++. There are two way to solve linear equations:

(1) The method of elimination. **(Gaussian elimination)**
(2) Determinants. **(Cramer's Rule)**

# 4-aspects that we should look into:
**(1) The geometry of linear equations.**
$\ \ \ 2- dimension  \rightarrow 3-dimension\ \rightarrow Higher\ dimension$
**(2) The interpretation of elimination is a "factorization" of the coefficient matrix.**
* $Ax=b$  $\ \ (\alpha,\beta,\gamma:scalar) \ (A,B,C:matrix)\ (a,b,c:vector)$
* $A=LU$ $(L:lower\ triangular\ matrix)\ (U:upper\ triangular\ matrix)$
* $A^T$/$A^{-1}$ $(T: transpose\ of\ matrix)(^{-1}: inverse\ of\ matrix)$
 
**(3) Irregular or singlar case (No unique solution)**
* No solution
* Infinite solution

**(4) Number of operations to solve system by elimination.**
