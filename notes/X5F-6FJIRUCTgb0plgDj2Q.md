I’d been looking for a clean M9 Bayonet Doppler for about two weeks, but most sites I visited were either overpriced or just flat-out unreliable. Half of them didn’t even show the float value or phase info, which makes it impossible to know what you’re buying. I almost gave up when I found [m9 bayonet doppler](https://dmarket.com/csgo-skins/product-card/m9-bayonet-doppler)  — it was the first place that gave me full item previews, up-to-date listings, and filters that actually work. I grabbed a solid Phase 3 with low float and the delivery was instant. Way smoother than I expected.
