## Current student association
### Student Union
Students have the capacity for self-governance and decision-making under the fundamental rights granted by the constitution. On May 26, 1995, the Judicial Yuan of Taiwan announced Constitutional Interpretation No. 380, which confirmed the protection of academic freedom, including the areas of research, teaching, and learning. This interpretation further clarified the scope of student autonomy and is safeguarded by the constitution. In other words, within the students' process of campus learning, students should be granted the power of autonomy within reasonable limits, which allows them to safeguard their own rights, participate in school affairs, and recognize responsibilities and obligations beyond their rights as students. At the same time, it is expected that students will acquire diverse knowledge and skills throughout this process.
