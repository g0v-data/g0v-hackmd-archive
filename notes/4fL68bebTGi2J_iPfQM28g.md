# Monorepos: Top Tools for Your Large-Scale Projects

This article is about the state of monorepos and presents useful resources for working on a big project. It describes a few exemplary products, such as [Nx](https://nx.dev/), [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/), [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/), and [Rush](https://rushjs.io/), which fulfill different development requirements. The discourse also explains how the said tools improve productivity, control dependencies, and allow different teams to work while eliminating friction. In addition to the latest updates and developments, the article seeks to assist teams in determining the best fit for a given project’s monorepo; performance considerations, build difficulty, and growth are some of the salient considerations. Furthermore, it examines the pros and cons of each instrument for the benefit of readers who would like to keep up with the changing trends in monorepo management.

## What is a Monorepo?
A monorepository, or [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/), is a singular source code repository for storing multiple projects or multiple components of a project in a larger system. Instead of each project or module having a different repository, they all reside in one. This particular arrangement makes code sharing, implementing similar development practices, and managing dependencies between several teams and applications much easier.

In a monorepo, all codebase components, e.g., frontend apps, backend services, and libraries are housed under one roof. This architecture helps to keep the development process streamlined in that all the projects can be done using the same set of tools, libraries, and configurations. It also facilitates inter-project work since the teams can be located in the same repository working on changing several projects at a time without the trouble of where to store other projects in different repos.

Monorepos are particularly advantageous for big firms that have several teams developing related products. In this way, centralization of the codebase helps to facilitate processes, eliminate redundancy, and enhance the quality of code. The main issue is how to keep the scale of the repository in check and good performance while increasing the number of projects and code size. To meet these objectives, specific tools such as Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, Lerna, and Rush have been created with sophisticated options to speed up builds, provide dependency management, and improve the overall performance of developers.

## Monorepos: Key Advantages
Monorepos provides marked advantages in project organization, particularly in large and complex projects, by enhancing code sharing, easing dependency management, enhancing interaction, and improving processes. These benefits come in handy in mitigating the challenges that might be faced by teams using several repositories, such as differing versions, lack of cohesive communication, and building over non-existing components. In this section, we will demonstrate how the monorepo approach facilitates code sharing across projects, provides centralized control over all dependencies, fosters improved developer collaboration, and enhance the development process efficiency through the use of smart cache and incremental builds. Real-life cases will also explain how different organizations make such vast projects manageable using large repositories. 

### Code Sharing and Reusability
In a monorepo, different teams or applications can access libraries, components, or utilities without the need for duplication. This promotes uniformity, reduces maintenance overhead, and the risk of 'version drift' occurring. For instance, a common library of shared UI components used by both web and mobile applications allows for user experiences to be consistent while not allowing different versions to be used. It also comes with a lot of automation such as dependency graphs and automated package updates, which want to help in the maintenance of these shared resources, and so, is included in monorepo tools like Nx and Turborepo.  

### Centralized Dependency Management
Coordinating interdependencies with multiple repositories usually turns out to be a challenge and leads to a lot of version and compatibility issues. On the other hand, Monorepos makes the management of such internal dependencies easier since they allow teams to manage dependencies in a single place. Any time a common library, package, or module is modified, all projects that rely on it will have access to the changes. This model guarantees uniformity and less exposure to risk from changes that may introduce errors to the system. Solutions such as Nx provide diagrams to demonstrate the dependencies, making it easier for the developers to understand how different modules interact, Turborepo makes it easy to manage complicated structures of nested packages, enabling easy upgrades. 

### Improved Collaboration and Visibility
Monorepositores encourage teamwork in multiple teams by making one common code base for all teams, which helps integrate various components of a project. A developer working with related components, for example, a backend and the corresponding front end, can do so in the same environment. This leads to openness where members can easily talk to each other, which in turn allows for extensive code checking and testing since all alterations can be seen in one place. More often than not, big teams prefer this spatial organization as it minimizes boundary restrictions and keeps everyone informed on the interrelationship of the work and the time to be spent on it. 

### Workflow Optimization with Caching and Incremental Builds
Monorepos can significantly enhance development processes by using caching and incremental builds. Bazel, Nx, Rush, and such tools make sure that when changes are made, only the changes in the codebase are rebuilt or retested, which maximizes development speed. For example, if a common library is altered, only the dependent applications will be rebuilt and not the other services that do not utilize the library. This optimization is essential in mitigating the frustration that follows many stages of builds for improvements in large projects. In this context, there would be a reduction in the waiting times and the resources used. Furthermore, using smart caching shoots sooner build times by utilizing the outputs from earlier builds when suitable; hence, both the development and CI/CD processes are simplified. 

### Real-World Adoption and Industry Examples
In recent years, several technology companies, including Google and Meta, have adopted monorepos to deal with their large and complex codebases. For example, Google’s Monorepo is a massive code repository that aggregates codes for several applications such as [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/), [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/), and others, making it easier for teams to work together and share resources. Similarly, [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) applies monorepo in handling its backbone architecture and internal tools to encourage a high level of code reuse and uniformity in engineering processes. The highlighted cases reflect the advantages of monorepos in terms of scope and effectiveness to the extent that large organizations do not compromise on quality while executing a myriad of projects.

Monorepos are useful in several ways in application building: code is used in building, project dependencies managed are few, project communication is high, and the processes are faster. In addition, some tools, such as Nx, Bazel, and Turborepo, enhance the way Monorepo is used, which enables more effective and more coherent management of a complex system.

## Nx Overview
Nx has established itself as one of the most loved solutions for handling monorepos, especially in the realms of Javascript and TypeScript. Built initially by Nrwl, it aims to improve the efficiency of large-scale development. It achieves this through various useful features such as modularization, dependency tracking, and build optimization. In the current section, we will delve into the tool, its capabilities for addressing modern development processes, an innovation in 2024, and projects that are best suited for it. 

### Key Features of Nx
Nx includes various features specifically designed to facilitate the creation of large applications. Thanks to its modular design, teams can split projects into smaller, self-contained portions, thus allowing for code sharing and reuse across different applications with relative ease. It has dependency graphs that visually depict the connections between projects and libraries, aiding in the management of components. It utilizes a unique and special command known as "affected" to identify the changed parts of the codebase that require attention. This means that testing and building are done only on relevant sections of the code, allowing for very short, effective cycles of delivery and feedback. On top of that, it has maps and generators that remove the need to repeat the same processes over and over, for example, when adding other modules or services, allowing development to be done faster.

### Strengths of Nx for Large Teams and Complex Projects
Nx is particularly preferred among large-sized teams working on modular or microservice architectures. There is a clear reason why this NPM’s approach to handling and controlling complex dependencies allows teams to work together without stepping into each other’s territories. For instance, let’s assume multiple applications are implementing the same authentication codebase. In this situation, to tackle the issue, it provides a way for all the applications to update any changes made to the codebase library.

Additionally, there are advantages associated with app development using Nx and already-established frameworks. Today, even a single code base can be used with different front-end and back-end projects using standardized tools and configurations, making it easy for UX/UI designers and developers. This makes it easier for organizations that develop fully-fledged products in the form of applications, enabling them to take care of both the front and the back of the application.

### Weaknesses of Nx
Nx is among the best tools for working with a monorepo because it has several excellent features, such as the management of dependency graphs, support for incremental builds, and efficient caching. Nevertheless, it has its strengths and weaknesses as well. For instance, one of the problems that it presents is that it is too much for smaller projects. The same features and tools appropriate for large-scale, complex projects may seem unnecessary to teams with only a few applications or even libraries to manage. The learning curve is also high for developers not used to working with monorepos or are new to using it because it comes with additional terms such as project generators, builders, and dependency graphs. 

Also, it should be noted that while it approaches this issue from the perspective of JavaScript/Typescript ecosystems, its systems for multi-language support are not as effective as those of Bazel. Any project that has worked in a few languages/technologies tends to find it more of a hindrance compared to tools made for differently complicated builds with more than one language. Lastly, while it offers some of its services in a cloud-based form, especially caching services with [Nx Cloud](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud), taking advantage of such a feature as distributed caching comes with increased operational management and complications in infrastructure provision. This is perceived as a hindrance during efforts aimed at adopting monorepo management practices in teams where simpler solutions are preferred and cloud services are not desired.

### Recent Innovations and Updates in 2024
In 2024, Nx has pronounced updates to cope with the growing demands of large-scale developments. The other improvement, perhaps the most significant, is that of distributed task execution, which enables the teams to perform their builds and tests on several machines, improving the performance of larger projects. It has also enhanced its support for incremental builds by improving its various strategies of caching to ensure that even the most complex chains of dependencies will only force the restoration of the parts of the code base that have been affected.

This monorepo tool has also designed new remote-caching tools to improve its developer experience, which enhances CI/CD speeds through the sharing of build artifacts across machines and developers. In addition, new plug-and-play support of non-JavaScript languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/) has made it appealing to cross-language projects, thus making it more useful.


### Ideal Use Cases for Nx
Nx is a boon when the team needs to work on several related projects simultaneously. It is perfect for businesses that have extensive fronted architectures, microservices, or compositional apps that leverage plenty of code sharing within them. For instance, a retail business building many shopping fronts can leverage it to provide design, authentication services, and product catalog libraries to web, mobile, and administrative applications. It takes care of making sure these components sync and avoid duplication and discrepancy.

It is also a good strategy for teams whose hydrogen is the DevOps and their cardinal resource is the considerably fast-build pipelines and automated testing. Thanks to its wise caching and affected command, developers can still be very productive, their distributed task execution shortens the time required for building even as the codebase accommodates more and more features. Anyway, it is suitable for individuals who create micro-frontends whether they are a startup or an enterprise, as they can control multiple frontend projects within one repo, hence enhancing deployment and versioning.

This tool is a clear leader among monorepo management tools and comes equipped with several advanced features that help modular development, building, and collaborating seamlessly. Moving on to the year 2024, it has made even greater strides, if that is conceivable, in the presentation of its product, which deals with the organization of work in monorepo, making it especially suitable for teams engaged in large and sophisticated projects. Its functional scope, addressing modern frameworks, eases new-age technologies, and the quest for speed and performance guarantees that it cuts across the rest of the available solutions within the monorepo landscape.

## Implementing Nx in a Project
Suppose you are designing a multi-platform e-commerce system with the following components:

* Customers can access a website to make orders.
* There is a mobile application available on both iOS and Android platforms.
* There is an admin dashboard for overseeing the products, orders, and users.
* There are common services like user authentication, product catalog, and payment processing.

The need to develop these applications in several separate code repositories would slow down various development processes, create contradictions, and make the management of dependencies complex. Therefore, you prefer to ossify a monorepo architecture with the help of Nx to make your processes more organized and enhance inter-team cooperation. Here is a practical way of how you do that.

### Step 1: Setting up the Monorepo with Nx
Begin with the installation, followed by creating a workspace:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace ecommerce --preset=empty
cd ecommerce
```

Next, use generators to scaffold the required projects. For instance:

```bash
nx generate @nx/react:app web-store  
nx generate @nx/react-native:app mobile-app  
nx generate @nx/react:app admin-dashboard  
```
This generates in the monorepo three applications—`web-store`, `mobile-app`, and `admin-dashboard`. You also create libraries for authentication and product management to be shared across applications.

```bash
nx generate @nx/js:lib shared-auth  
nx generate @nx/js:lib product-catalog  
```
These libraries are found in a `libs/` folder and can be accessed and used by all three applications.

### Step 2: Managing Dependencies and Code Reuse
Once the appropriate dependencies have been added, the website and the mobile app depend on the `shared-auth` library for user authentication and the `product-catalog` library to fetch and display products. As can be done in every other case, the use of Nx’s dependency graph allows for an easy enumeration and representation of the relationships between such projects and libraries:

```bash
nx graph  
```
It aids in knowing which applications are dependent on which library. In the event of a modification made to the `shared-auth` library, Nx ensures that the only impacted apps, such as the `web-store` and `mobile-app` are the only ones rebuilt and tested, excluding the `admin-dashboard`. When writing your code, you will be able to import the shared libraries as follows:

```javascript
// web-store/src/app/App.js  
import { login } from '@ecommerce/shared-auth';  

const handleLogin = () => {  
  login(username, password).then(...);  
};
```
In this example, we observe the `App.js` file having an import referring to a shared `login` function from a shared authentication package called// web-store/src/app/App.js  
import { login } from '@ecommerce/shared-auth';  

const handleLogin = () => {  
  login(username, password).then(...);  
}; (`@ecommerce/shared-auth`). This hints that this authentication logic can be reused from one component to the other. The `handleLogin` method invokes that function and provides the arguments `username` and `password` for the parameters. It probably returns a promise that is waited for by `.then(...)` to take some actions following the result of a login attempt, such as moving the user to another page or presenting them with some message. This approach encourages the reuse of code as all the authentication logic is placed in one module, which can be easily updated and used in different applications or services within the monorepo. The consolidation of such libraries means that all the applications will be working with the same authentication logic, thereby minimizing redundancy and upholding uniformity.

### Step 3: Optimizing CI/CD with Caching and Affected Builds
To optimize and speed up feedback, this team uses Nx caching and affected builds. Thus, whenever developers make code changes, push those changes to the repository, create new tests, or attempt to rebuild, then only the modified parts of the codebase are being tested and rebuilt.

For instance, when a `shared-auth` library is updated by a developer, web-store and mobile-app get rebuilt only. You can use the following command to build the affected applications and their dependencies:

```bash
nx affected --target=build  
```
As a result, CI/CD is time-efficient since only pertinent applications go through building and testing phases, improving overall productivity.

Additionally, it is possible to accelerate pipelines by allowing remote cache access when using it. It allows the distribution of the built artifacts over the machines, so if one developer builds the same code the CI system is building, that output can be utilized by your CI system.

### Step 4: Distributed Task Execution
With the extension of the project, the time taken to build and test also elongates. To counter that, you enable distributed task execution so that Nx will run tasks on more than one machine. As a result, the monorepo scales well with the growth of the codebase.

```bash
nx run-many --target=build --parallel  
```
This command simultaneously runs builds for different projects, decreasing wait times and enabling quicker releases.

### Step 5: Deployments and Continuous Delivery
Every application existing within the monorepo, be it a `web-store`, a `mobile-app`, or an `admin-dashboard`, is deployed in its own right. Nevertheless, with the aid of Nx’s affected builds policy, only the relevant application will be redeployed where changes are made. For instance:

In case a developer makes a change in the mobile UI, only the mobile-app build will be run, and accordingly, the mobile application will be released. If a fix for a bug that resides in `shared-auth` library affects `web-store` and `mobile-app`, both applications will be rebuilt and redeployed simultaneously. 

```bash
nx affected --target=deploy --parallel  
```
This operation can also be accomplished by configuring deployment scripts within Nx.

## Turborepo Overview
Turborepo is an advanced management system for monorepos that allows for fast builds and easy management and setup, particularly for projects in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that require speed. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) created the tool with particular emphasis on front-end coding, as it is mainly focused on performance and is easy to use. Because of such features, such as caching task orchestration and integration with the most popular frameworks, it is often used by those teams that tend to work on several projects. This section will cover notable features of Turborepo, its advantages and pitfalls satisfying innovations of 2024, and cases when it is the most suitable solution for your assignment.

### Key Features of Turborepo
The main focus of the architecture of Turborepo is task caching and parallel execution, which contribute to building processes running faster by utilizing already processed files. Let’s say a task was processed previously with the same set of influences, then it will not process it again but fetch the data from the cache. This comes very handy in CI pipelines where performing the same builds in particular time spans is quite tedious. Also, to ease the burden on developers, Turborepo provides local and remote caching capabilities as a standard to help developers utilize their artifacts on different machines.

Another beneficial feature is the so-called task pipelines, which enable developers to attach tasks. For instance, your project has multiple stages: running tests, producing packages, and putting up applications. Turborepo will schedule these tasks to run in the right sequence only when there are changes made. Turbo’s straightforward configuration using `turbo.json` allows the team to set up the pipelines without writing complicated codes, which is also beneficial for small teams.

### Strengths of Turborepo
In projects with a heavy focus on the front end, where the speed of building or deploying applications is crucial, Turborepo shines. It works perfectly with Next.js and React, thus making it an asset for the web development division. For instance, a SaaS company having numerous frontend applications can use Turborepo in the development process to enable component and dependency sharing among the applications.

Because of Turborepo’s emphasis on easing the use of the tool, this can appeal to teams that wish to use monorepo strategies without the excess burden of the method. From day one, it gives an easy out-of-the-box experience, provision of it’s task runner requires a little configuration, and fast performance is achieved. This means that even young or smaller teams that may not have a single person in charge of DevOps can still enjoy monorepo advantages.

The productivity of the developers also comes out as another benefit of using Turborepo. The system is hot-rodded and supports incremental builds, which permits the developers to test the consequences of their modifications almost instantaneously. In addition, remote caching further enhances this by enabling each developer to use previously generated build outputs, leading to better teamwork in geographically dispersed areas.

### Recent Innovations and Updates in 2024
A lot of enhancements have been made by Turborepo in 2024 to ensure that it remains able to compete well in the market. One of the notable updates is the enhancement of the integration with Vercel’s platform for deployment, which provides for continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines with ease for Next.js applications. This alleviates the problem of the teams having to undergo a long and complex deployment of the applications in the monorepo, especially in configuring the steps properly. 

Improvement of the previously existing enhancements to the remote caching system of Turborepo is another addition made to support team members working in different time zones. Because of this, developers have also been given more sophisticated control over the controls that cause cache-clearing, which prevents the problem of new work being commenced with an old building. Equally important, it has also enhanced its framework support to encompass a wider range of server-related technologies, including [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), making it useful for more than just client-side applications. This revision increases the usability of Turborepo by enabling it to handle applications that comprise both the backend and the front end.

### Ideal Use Cases for Turborepo
Turborepo is an ideal solution for focused teams developing front-end or full-stack applications where speed and frequent release cycles matter most. This is perfect for young businesses developing [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas#:~:text=) solutions because it allows for short iterations and easy handling of multiple front-end apps and their common dependencies.

Take, for instance, a business having multiple web apps built with React, such as a brand’s website, an admin dashboard, and a client-facing portal. Turborepo allows them to create and share interface pieces as well as style the apps in a universal manner. Since it uses task pipelines and caching, the developers will not need to build or test everything but only what has been modified, which improves development speed and CI pipelines.

It also enables effective collaboration between team members working in different geographic locations on the same project. Thanks to remote caching, if one user creates an application’s part, other users do not have to do it again as they can utilize that output. This is particularly useful for organizations that have employees in different locations or implement continuous delivery.

## Implementing Turborepo in a Project
Suppose, for the sake of argument, you are developing single-sourced applications that are offered to multiple clients simultaneously and which feature several web applications, among them:

* Client Dashboard: It is a React-based application through which users manage their accounts. 

* Admin Panel: This is an internal administrative panel geared towards keeping track of users and activities taking place on the system.

* Marketing Website: A Next.js site aimed at potential clients learning about the service and registering for it.

* Shared Component Library: Collection of utility functions like buttons, input boxes, modals, etc. integrated through all the apps.

* Shared Utilities: Refers to the backend infrastructure, such as the authentication service or API clients, applicable in both client and admin apps.

Utilizing Turborepo will enable you to organize these apps in a monorepo without breaking a sweat while keeping the work well-managed and the common code properly leveraged.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Monorepo
As a first step, create a new workspace in Turborepo:

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest my-saas-platform
cd my-saas-platform
```
Inside the workspace, you create the application modules and the common libraries:

```bash
mkdir -p apps/client-dashboard apps/admin-panel apps/marketing-site  
mkdir -p packages/ui-library packages/utils
```
Currently, you have three applications and two common packages (user interface elements along with utility functions), structured as given below:

```bash
/apps
  /client-dashboard
  /admin-panel
  /marketing-site
/packages
  /ui-library
  /utils
```

### Step 2: Configuring the Task Pipelines
Every application has to leverage the common libraries and observe some processes—for instance, constructing the UI library before the apps. With Turborepo, task dependencies are set in a configuration file referred to as `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "lint": {},
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```
With this setting, applications rely on the build task of the `ui-library` and `utils` packages. Linting and testing are also automatically performed after the build. In the dev mode, caching is turned off so that developers can see the newest changes instantly.

### Step 3: Sharing Components and Utilities Across Apps
Given that all applications require the same design and functional logic, the UI library and utilities are imported into the applications. Let’s take, for instance, the case of `client-dashboard`:

```bash
cd apps/client-dashboard
npm install ../../packages/ui-library ../../packages/utils
```
In your code, you include the shared components as follows:

```javascript
// apps/client-dashboard/src/App.js
import { Button } from "@my-saas-platform/ui-library";
import { fetchUserData } from "@my-saas-platform/utils";

const Dashboard = () => {
  const handleFetchData = async () => {
    const data = await fetchUserData();
    console.log(data);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to your dashboard!</h1>
      <Button onClick={handleFetchData}>Load Data</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;
```
Here’s how the provided code can be explained. It implements a React functional component called `Dashboard`. The purpose of this component is to act as the primary interface for the client’s dashboard in a SaaS application. Near the beginning of the file, two modules have been imported. The button component from the shared `@my-saas-platform/ui-library` package. This is a reusable UI part that enables uniform appearance across many applications in the same monorepo. The `fetchUserData` function from the `@my-saas-platform/utils` package. This is a utility function that implements the logic for getting the user’s data, which encourages code reuse and minimizes code duplication.

In the Dashboard component, the `handleFetchData` function is declared asynchronous and sets out to presumably call `fetchUserData()` with the intention of retrieving user data. The requested data gets outputted into the console using `console.log(data)`. Such activity can be activated via a button; in simple terms, the app goes on to fetch the data (at least the fetching is simulated currently using the console) when the button is clicked by the user.

In the [JSX](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) that the component returns, there is a wrap of the user interface provided within a single div element. Within the `div`, there is a heading or a title `(<h1>)` that reads, “Welcome to your dashboard!” as a form of salutation to the user. Under the heading, the button component imported is displayed. The button is responsive and has an `onClick` event that calls the `fetchData` function.

This minimalistic user interface demonstrates the implementation of shared components and utilities in the client dashboard application. While the button component is a universal component that looks the same on the application, there is a utility that takes care of pulling the users' data. This approach enables enhancing the system in modules and therefore keeping the dashboard thin and easy to change over time.


### Step 4: Optimizing Builds with Caching and Incremental Builds
During software development or Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), there are no excessive builds, you use the caching feature of Turborepo. When issuing the command to perform a build, every task's outputs are stored by Turborepo:

```bash
turbo run build
```
If the `ui-library` and `utils` have not been altered since the last build, Turborepo uses the cached build artifacts and does not repeat the tasks. This makes for quick builds even in large projects that have numerous dependencies. Also, switching on remote caching allows results to be shared across the team. This eliminates the situation where team members have to wait for builds that another team member or the CI has already performed.

```bash
turbo login
turbo link <remote-cache-id>
```
When remote caching is set up, every team member utilizes all the previous builds, and there is no work duplication, which in turn accelerates the feedback cycle.

### Step 5: Implementing CI/CD with Turborepo
Within your CI/CD pipeline, you set up Turborepo such that it builds and deploys only the relevant applications. For instance, if a modification occurs in the ui-library, a rebuild and deployment are only necessary for the client-dashboard and admin-panel applications.

```bash
turbo run build --filter=...client-dashboard
```
This command guarantees that only the client-dashboard and its dependencies (for example, the UI library) will be built again. Likewise, Turborepo pipelines can also be used to automate the deployments:
```bash
turbo run deploy --filter=apps/marketing-site
```
This guarantees that the marketing website is only deployed when there are pertinent modifications, thus reducing unnecessary deployments and wasted time.

## Bazel Overview
Bazel is designed as a build-management system capable of dealing with large volumes of codes with multiple dependencies—and it was initially offered by [Google](https://www.google.com/) itself. It is built to scale; it is fast and works correctly. That is why the Bazel build system has proven useful for projects that can be complicated and have large groups of people working on projects that have native support for lots of languages. Its complex caches, simultaneous operations, and detailed management of dependencies make it ideal for corporate applications, backends, and even deep learning research. In this part, we will analyze the primary characteristics and advantages of Bazel, its drawbacks, and its comparison with modern monorepo tools such as Nx and Turborepo.

### Strengths of Bazel
Bazel is optimized for handling large and intricate applications where managing dependencies is often the breaking point. Consider the case of an organization where thousands of microservices are maintained on a single repository and are coded in different programming languages. Such organizations will find it rather appropriate that Bazel rebuild only what is required. This makes a lot of sense because one can find that huge amounts of time can be saved through development and even continuous integration.

It is also suitable for large teams working together because its nature is distributed. Build tasks can also be done on several computers, which is a must for building CI/CD systems. For example, big companies using several node-building Bazel clusters are capable of distributing tasks, which shortens the period of building and testing. Its hermetic builds also provide a kind of build-level consistency, as the same build artifacts are produced regardless of the location of the build.

Bazel supports the addition of custom rules, and this offers another great benefit. Developers can come up with build rules that are in line with their peculiar needs, and thus it can accommodate even the most bespoke of build pipes. 

### Weaknesses of Bazel
Bazel, however, is not without its disadvantages, as it has a very steep learning curve. In other words, understanding build systems is a prerequisite knowledge before one can successfully configure Bazel for a project, and if a team has never worked with the [Starlark](https://bazel.build/rules/language) language, the configuration files may be difficult to comprehend.

Also, there is a problem with the integration of the tooling. Indeed, Bazel does not depend on the programming languages, but superior support for Bazel is not always guaranteed in every programming ecosystem. For example, front-end developers, in most cases, will find it difficult to work with tooling such as Angular and React. Hence, such an organization would be best suited for a firm that has well-developed DevOps capabilities or one that is predominantly back-end in nature.

### Comparison with Nx and Turborepo
When it comes to advanced build optimization, Bazel has the upper hand over Nx and Turborepo in backend [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)#:~:text=) projects. In contrast to Nx and Turborepo, which are largely JavaScript and frontend-centric, it accepts repositories where many languages can coexist. For instance, an organization that builds a machine learning pipeline and a web interface can employ Bazel to perform both Python model compilation and JavaScript code compilation from the same monorepo.

Nonetheless, there are challenges in adopting Bazel compared to its Nx and Turborepo counterparts. While infrastructures such as Nx and Turborepo are designed to reduce the installation pain with simple setups, it requires a considerable amount of effort to install. Teams have to choose between whether they want to explore and go through the process of learning how to effectively use Bazel or simply use the powerful features it has.

### Ideal Use Cases for Bazel
Bazel is great for large organizations, or teams, that deal with complicated interconnected systems, especially those composed of many languages. A good example is a bank developing a multi-service backend in Java and Python, alongside a mobile application; they would find it useful that it allows compiling everything from one large repository. Its remote execution features guarantee that large teams are capable of efficient building with all the participating developers sharing build artifacts.

It is also appropriate to say that it fits DevOps-based organizations that dedicate time to make the build system efficient. For example, a cloud-based model service building both infrastructure and customer applications can use Bazel for controlling the commissioning and testing processes together.

## Implementing Bazel in a Project
Imagine that you are designing a logistics management system that would operate on a societal level and support many languages. This system has numerous building blocks, as enumerated below:

* [Java](https://www.java.com/) and Python-based backend microservices for order processing, enabling geolocation of deliveries, and controlling warehouse activities.
* Application for the mobile drivers is developed in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for Android devices.
* The operations management web dashboard is built on React and TypeScript.
* Common libraries (for instance, API clients and helper methods) that are utilized by different backend systems and applications.

Bazel is an ideal candidate in this scenario because it effectively incorporates multi-language builds, incremental compilation, and remote execution, allowing for the building, testing, and deployment of all the components from a monorepo. Below is the procedure on how one would go about implementing Bazel in this project step by step.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Monorepo
In the beginning, you will need to establish a monorepo arrangement within which all of your components and services will be organized:

```bash
/apps
  /mobile-app
  /web-dashboard
/services
  /order-management
  /delivery-tracking
  /warehouse
/libraries
  /shared-utils
  /api-clients
```
Furthermore, individual Bazel build files `(BUILD.bazel)` will be created for each service and application, so that dependencies will be maintained and only affected sections will be rebuilt during development and/or deployment.

### Step 2: Configuring Bazel Build Files
To define targets (construction, testing, runtime, etc.), each directory (whether service, application, or library) will require a `BUILD.bazel` file. Let us examine the case of order-management service, which is a Java-based project, as an example.

```python
# services/order-management/BUILD.bazel

java_library(
    name = "order_management_lib",
    srcs = glob(["src/main/java/**/*.java"]),
    deps = ["//libraries/api-clients:client_lib"],
)

java_binary(
    name = "order_management_service",
    main_class = "com.example.order.OrderManagementApplication",
    deps = [":order_management_lib"],
)
```
This setup specifies a target in the Java library known as `order_management_lib` along with a binary target for the particular service. The library makes use of the shared `api-clients/library`, which provides the common APIs, helping in the reuse of codes.

In the case of the web-dashboard (which is a React project), the `BUILD.bazel` file can be structured as follows:

```python
# apps/web-dashboard/BUILD.bazel

nodejs_binary(
    name = "web_dashboard",
    entry_point = "src/index.tsx",
    deps = ["//libraries/shared-utils"],
)
```
In the `BUILD.bazel` document, the target web dashboard has been created using the `nodejs_binary `rule. This rule indicates that the entry point of this target would be the `index.txt `file found under the `src` folder. It also states a dependency on the library found at `//libraries/shared-utils` since it is necessary for the web_dashboard application build. This arrangement helps Bazel correctly compile and package the dashboard using the relevant entry file and its dependencies.

### Step 3: Using Incremental Builds and Dependency Tracking
As developers focus on separate parts, Bazel’s fine-grained dependency tracking makes sure that only the part of the code that gets affected is rebuilt. For example, if a developer works on the integration of an API client library, only the services or applications that rely on it, like the order-management service or the web dashboard, will be rebuilt by Bazel. When working locally, a developer can execute:

```bash
bazel build //apps/web-dashboard
```
Bazel will build only the requisite parts. If nothing inside the `shared-utils` library nor the web dashboard code has been modified since the last build made by the user, it just gets the results from the cache, which expedites the build process considerably.

### Step 4: Configuring Remote Execution and Caching
Because the logistics platform is being developed by a distributed team, you enable [remote caching](https://bazel.build/remote/caching) so that all the team members and CI/CD pipelines can share build outputs. This means that any builds created on one machine can be utilized on another machine without doing the build again.

To set up remote caching, you will need to adjust Bazel settings in such a way that a cloud-based cache backend is used:

```bash
bazel build --remote_cache=[REMOTE_CACHE_URL]
```
In this configuration, storage of the outcome is made remotely each time a developer initiates a build. Other developers or CI work can access these outcomes, thus helping to prevent unnecessary rebuilding.

### Step 5: Integrating Bazel into CI/CD Pipelines
In your continuous integration continuous deployment (CI/CD) system, Bazel’s involvement is critical for builds and deployments. When a change is made to the repository, the CI pipeline calls a Bazel build to compile only the services and applications relevant to the change.

As an illustration, let’s say a software engineer works on the delivery tracking service, then the pipeline would be executed:

```bash
bazel build //services/delivery-tracking
```
Bazel will make certain that only the necessary service and its dependencies (for instance, shared libraries) will be rebuilt, thus saving resources and time.

After the development is completed, you can also perform testing on the project using:

```bash
bazel test //services/delivery-tracking:all
```
This guarantees that only the tests of the impacted components will run. After that, the modified service is automatically put into action as long as the tests pass.

### Step 6: Deploying Multiple Components with Bazel
In addition, Bazel provides infrastructure for multi-target deployments, which allows the deployment of several services or applications from the same pipeline. Immersing yourself in this example, if there is an update in the API client library and deployment of both mobile applications supported and web dashboards is needed, you may execute:

```bash
bazel build //apps/mobile-app //apps/web-dashboard
```
This command makes sure that both of these components are built with the latest and greatest changes and are production-ready.

## Lerna Overview
Lerna is one of the most effective JavaScript (particularly Node.js, React, and Typescript) tools for monorepo maintenance. Originally, Lerna focused on the problem of handling dependencies and versions in repositories with multiple packages. However, it has gradually developed to embrace several other functions, such as package publishing, management of interdependencies, and executing scripts over different projects, to mention a few. Lerna makes it easier to develop many packages, which are related and ought to be maintained in a single repository, by offering commands to control their interdependencies and processes. This section looks into the various features offered by this tool, its advantages and disadvantages considering other tools, and in which projects this tool is the most appropriate one.

### Key Features of Lerna
Lerna comes with various primary features that sustain the need for JavaScript projects. It gives the management of packages in two ways: fixed mode, meaning all the packages have one version, and independent mode, where each package can have its own version. This makes it possible for teams to decide whether they want all packages to be released at the same time or, depending on the package, some of them to be released on their schedule.

Another capability of Lerna that I consider to be among the most helpful is dependency hoisting. In a standard multi-package repository, each package may install its dependencies, and this can lead to redundancy and longer installation times. Common dependencies, on the other hand, are held at the root of the repository, which minimizes redundancy and enhances efficiency. This is, however, an advantage in managing the dependencies that are used by different packages and in uniformity within the packages as well.

To make things easier, it also provides tools for publishing with commands such as `lerna-publish`, which allows developers to publish several packages into npm with a single command. It also checks for the changes in the packages since the last release, and therefore only the current packages are published. Most importantly, Lerna facilitates the running of scripts in multiple packages using `lerna-run`, which can be used to build or test run the scripts across different packages in parallel.

### Strengths of Lerna
Lerna is primarily designed for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos and hence is frequently deployed for the management of frontend libraries, libraries of React components, and backend APIs. It eases the processes of operating in various ways by enabling the running of scripts across the packages and publishing them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) with ease. Executing such tasks becomes more efficient with it, as teams working on such applications, i.e., where factors bearing dependencies, such as a design system, are broken into several packages.

For instance, let us assume a team is working on a React component library that has multiple packages implemented for buttons, forms, and navigational components. In this case, Lerna would allow the developers to make updates to the button package and push them as a new release while at the same time allowing the update of the form and navigational component packages, or even the entire release could be made in a coordinated manner. This also makes it possible for the components to be designed in a way that they are self-sufficient and can have different versioning, which is convenient to the users.

Lerna is also very easy to install because it requires very little to no setup to begin working with it. For development teams that have experience with npm or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), moving to Lerna is not much of a big deal as it does not conflict with the underlying Javascript processes. Its hoisting features mean smaller installation times, especially beneficial in larger monorepos with many dependencies.

### Weaknesses of Lerna
Notwithstanding its merits, Lerna also has flaws. One performance issue is the tendency for a project to slow down as it becomes more extensive and intricate, which is the case in monorepos, which have numerous published packages that depend on each other. The integrated use of npm or Yarn ship tools with Lerna can lead to unnecessary prolonged build and script run times when compared with highly efficient systems such as Nx or Turborepo.

Furthermore, advanced built-in build and caching functionalities are yet to be provided by Lerna. Running scripts across packages is possible, but build and run operations are not available, such as the incremental builds, task pipelines, or remote caching seen in Turborepo and Bazel. This renders it inappropriate for a build system for very complex, large projects with extensive build systems.

To add to the problem, it has a major drawback in that it is centered around JavaScript. It does not cater to polyglot monorepos, which limits its application in projects spanning a variety of languages. This poses a problem for its use in applications where the backend code is majority or in companies having to deal with a large scale, multiple programming languages code all in one.

### Comparison with Nx and Turborepo
Lerna is still a great utility for handling multi-package javascript repositories, but it is somehow inferior to Nx and Turborepo. For example, Nx and Turborepo include additional functionalities such as caching, task orchestration, and visualizing a graph of interdependent tasks, which can accelerate the work done. In contrast, it is fairly simple and is mainly designed to manage the versioning and distribution of packages.

For groups whose main task is to create React libraries or implement Node.js-based APIs, Lerna could be a really helpful tool. Nonetheless, when the complexity of the monorepo increases, teams may run into certain issues limiting the performance, which can make them consider switching to either Turborepo or Nx. These two, however, are more appropriate for use in projects where builds have to be executed quickly and more complex coordination of services is needed.

### Ideal Use Cases for Lerna
In particular, Lerna is suitable for teams that are creating front-end libraries, design systems, or even modular JavaScript applications. To illustrate, companies designing design systems can have different components such as buttons, forms, and typography utilities, and they can use Lerna to control the versioning and publishing of those packages.

This is also the case in organizations that develop backend Node.js applications with the use of shared libraries. For instance, a SaaS provider and its various microservices, which share authentication and API client libraries, can use Lerna to handle the common libraries and version them in isolation.

It becomes even more useful in projects that envisage constant publishing to npm. Often open-source maintainers who are constructing JavaScript frameworks or utility libraries as a multi-organization effort utilize Lerna to deal with various packages that reside in the same repository without any hiccups in the release process.

## Implementing Lerna in a Project
Suppose you are working on a SaaS product that consists of dozens of JavaScript libraries and services. The product contains the following components: A component library in React containing various reusable UI components, such as buttons, forms, and modals; A backend service created in Node.js that contains a common authentication microservice enabling secure communication between multiple services. A command-line interface for the deployment of applications and data migrations. Common utility libraries (like validation and API client libraries) are used by both the front-end and back-end. In this project, Lerna will come in handy in organizing multiple packages kept in the monorepo, making sure that shared libraries and interdependencies are all versioned, tested, and deployed properly.

### Step 1: Setup and installation
Utilize Lerna to administrate the following package structure in the creation of a monorepo empire:

```bash
/packages
  /ui-library      # React component library
  /auth-service    # Backend service with authentication logic
  /cli-tool        # Deployment CLI tool
  /shared-utils    # Shared utilities for frontend and backend
```
Every subfolder in the packages directory is partitioned by each package, and all inter-package dependencies shall be handled by it. 

To begin with, let’s install Lerna globally on your system and also set the monorepo: 

```
npm install -g lerna
lerna init
```

Please note that executing this command will create a `lerna.json` file in the main directory of your project. The file is editable; for example, you may want to change it to allow partial versioning (making it possible for every package to have a separate version):

```bash
{
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "version": "independent"
}
```

This setup procedure is useful such that two distinct packages—such as the UI library and CLI tool—may be versioned differently and their updates pushed and released without coordinating the version of the other package.

### Step 2: Adding Dependencies and Hoisting
One of the features offered by Lerna is dependency hoisting, which means common dependencies will be installed at the root level to prevent repetition. For instance, if several packages use [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), it will be installed only once in the root directory. To enable hoisting, add to `lerna.json`: 

```json
{
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "version": "independent",
  "npmClient": "npm",
  "hoist": true
}
```

Now, let us use Lerna to individually install dependencies for the packages:

```bash
lerna bootstrap
```

This command, on the other hand, associates all of a local package's external dependencies with the installed package and installs external dependencies. For instance, the `ui-library` package is allowed to resolve the `shared-utils` package as follows:

```bash
// packages/ui-library/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@my-saas-platform/shared-utils": "*"
  }
}
```

After bootstrapping, Lerna takes care of linking the installed packages defined in the local workspace to their respective versions provided in the global workspace.

### Step 3: Running Scripts Across Packages and Publishing Changes
Lerna can be utilized to execute commands across different packages. For example, to run tests in all the packages, one can use:

```bash
lerna run test
```

With this command, all the packages having a test script will run their tests concurrently. In the same way, builds can be executed:

```bash
lerna run build
```

This is very useful in a CI environment, making sure all packages are tested and built before they are released.

Lerna streamlines the usage of publishing tools by checking which packages have been modified since the last publication. For instance, in case you would like to synchronize the `shared-utils` library, it will recognize the edit and publish the new edition of the library: 

```bash
lerna publish
```
In independent mode, Lerna will prompt for a new version for each modified package (ex. `shared-utils` will become 1.1.0). After this is agreed, Lerna will:

1. Change the versions of the changed packages.
2. Add new versions and make corresponding git commits and tags.
3. Distribute the new versions of packages to npm.

For instance, when `shared-utils` are updated and other packages like `ui-library` make use of `shared-utils`, their dependencies will also get updated to the latest version automatically.

### Practical Outcome
The Lerna tool, for instance, allows one to manage a SaaS platform from all angles where its components can be added or removed quite easily. The UI library, backend services, and shared utilities all exist in a single monorepo, making building, testing, and deploying them simple. For instance, if you change the auth logic of the app in the backend (backend service auth-service), all dependent packages, like CLI and front-end UI, will update automatically thanks to [symlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) by Lerna. When it comes to releasing these, it makes sure that only the packages that have been changed or added get published, thereby causing the least inconvenience to users. This approach is also more cohesive in that it promotes the reuse of codes. Thus, developers working on different aspects of the platform can use the common libraries, and all the relevant codes are accessible in a single location, which also promotes efficiency.

## Rush Overview
Rush is a tool for managing monorepo that boasts high-performance consistency and scalability that fit enterprise-grade solutions. It is a Google-built package; it offers an efficient solution to issues such as dependency management, build time reduction, and most importantly, package management across different groups. It has an advanced mechanism for supporting consistent processes and turnaround times, which proves useful when dealing with projects that require sustaining high-capacity CI/CD systems for extended periods. This portion delves into its characteristics, advantages, and applications, answering how exactly the Rush tool differs from others and when it is necessary regarding monorepo management.

### Key Features of Rush
Rush provides the capability of deterministic versioning based on the "shrinkwrap file’ feature, wherein all developers and CI systems have to use the same dependency versions. It prevents mismatched versions of packages inside the library and between different packages inside the scope to avoid “it works on my machine” scenarios in other tools like Lerna, which are dependent on npm or yarn. This fostered uniformity in development systems.

The other advantage of Rush is the ability to orchestrate builds over a potentially infinite scale. It will even support building the artifacts in portions, which means it will run only the parts of the build process affected by the last change, thereby enhancing speed. It also incorporates some level of parallelization and task scheduling for efficient utilization of execution resources within the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which is useful for projects that have many dependencies.

With Rushe's workspace mode (which is also available in [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)), dependency management gets even better as packages are locally linked, reducing the overhead of installing repeated packages in the storage system. Thus, it is suited for companies with extensive repositories that have hundreds of dependent packages.

### Strengths of Rush
Rush is designed primarily for performance, dependency management, and consistency, thus making it appropriate for large-scale enterprise applications. It allows the smooth operation of complicated monorepos, which in turn consist of various back-end and front-end applications, shared libraries, and many teams all functioning at the same time. It connects to pnpm, which allows the monorepos management without installing a huge amount of dependency packages over `node_modules` folders persisting in each project.

As an illustration, suppose there is a wide range of product offerings comprising applications such as web dashboards, back-office services in the form of APIs, and shared tools. In that case, Rush makes it possible to build, test, and release each one of them and their functional additions without repeating efforts or doing something unnecessary. The development guidelines quicken the pace of progression by allowing the build process only to apply to the sections that have been altered due to changes.

Rush additionally leads in dependency management policies amongst other frameworks. Also, it is a policy that all the packages should include package dependencies within them which avoids the situation of a version drift where certain areas of the monorepo have inconsistent dependency versions. This aspect is one of the reasons why it is much loved in corporations where versioning and build expectance are mandatory.

‘Change files’ system is another exceptional facility that it offers. When any package is updated by developers, change files have to be created and included with the request describing what has changed and the reason for the changes. This is attached to a pull request, making sure accurate records are kept of any additions made for future releases, which compensates for the long hours put into writing code. This characteristic promotes the two values in a work environment - transparency and responsibility and is beneficial in environments where there is intense regulation or in big corporations.

### Weaknesses of Rush
Rush has many advantages, but it’s harder to learn than other tools such as Lerna or Turborepo. Since it is designed primarily for enterprise-grade management, smaller or less demanding applications may be deemed too complicated. Furthermore, the first stage may require more work since it tends to be very strict on the way dependencies and policies are managed. 

Similarly, in terms of performance, Rush is tailored towards JavaScript and TypeScript-centric environments. It can manage a polyglot repository (a monorepo containing multiple languages); however, there are better tools for this, such as Bazel, which is designed to work in such diverse environments instead of polyglot repositories. In addition, it needs tasks to be configured very well for it to make good use of parallelization. This configuration overhead may prove to be a burden for teams that are not used to working with fully optimized build pipelines.

### Comparison with Nx and Turborepo
On the other hand, Rush is more appropriate for bigger, more complicated projects than Nx and Turborepo. Nx is centered around equipping developers with various elements like dependency graphs and generators, making it easier to use smaller teams. On the other side, Turborepo is all about caching and task pipeline performance optimization, with dependency management being somewhat loose, unlike Rush, where it is strict. It's most significant merit is its unbending arrangement and ability to maintain standardization. The organization, as the structure provides controlled versioning, step builds, and detailed dependency management, makes it even more favorable for big corporations or industries with stringent design and deployment processes in place.

### Ideal Use Cases for Rush
Rush portrays itself as an optimal solution for big monorepos containing enterprise-level projects that are going to be run by many teams over a prolonged period. For instance, if an organization is developing a family of SaaS applications that consist of web apps, backend APIs, and mobile apps, Rush makes sure that all of their components work together consistently and efficiently.

It is also appropriate for verticals like finance, healthcare, and government, which are highly regulated. In such cases, there is a need for rigorous control of the dependencies and builds, and Rush's policies and change file system help to create such control and define the limits.

For instance, if a fintech company operates several applications that carry common authentication strategies and reporting engines, Rush guarantees that every module uses the same versions of the dependencies and ensures that changes are made in a controlled and regulated fashion.

### Implementing Rush in a Project
Imagine you are in charge of a multiproduct SaaS platform, and several teams with various functions are working on different components and libraries of the system. The project includes:

* Customer Dashboard: A React frontend for the users.
* Admin Portal: An Angular application meant for administrators.
* API Gateway: A backend built in Node.js to enable the frontend’s interaction with several microservices.
* [Auth](https://authjs.dev/) Library: A universal authentication library present in both the front and back-end services.
* CLI Tool: A tool for deploying and maintaining the resource base.

Therefore, in this case, it would be beneficial to help deploy this type of project in a monorepo with traditional versioning, several builds, and even a wheel depot of dependencies.

### Step 1: Setting up the Monorepo
Start the permission project by structuring it in the following manner:

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
rush init
```

Each of the directories under apps, services, libraries, and tools encapsulates a package or service that they take care of in this monorepo.

To start with, install Rush globally and set up the system.

This will generate configuration files like `rush.json`. The `rush.json` file outlines how the project is arranged and what the project settings are.

Here is an example:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    { "packageName": "customer-dashboard", "projectFolder": "apps/customer-dashboard" },
    { "packageName": "admin-portal", "projectFolder": "apps/admin-portal" },
    { "packageName": "api-gateway", "projectFolder": "services/api-gateway" },
    { "packageName": "auth-library", "projectFolder": "libraries/auth-library" },
    { "packageName": "shared-utils", "projectFolder": "libraries/shared-utils" },
    { "packageName": "cli-tool", "projectFolder": "tools/cli-tool" }
  ],
  "pnpmVersion": "8.0.0"  
}
```
This configuration is about the architecture of a monorepo that has several projects. Each project is defined by its `packageName` and its relevant repository relative location. It contains a variety of applications such as `customer-dashboard` and `admin-portal`, services like `api-gateway`, libraries including `auth-library` and `shared-utils`, and tools, for instance, `cli-tool`. The presence of `pnpmVersion: 8.0.0` stipulates that this monorepo adopts the use of pnpm as its package manager to achieve controlled handling of dependencies across the repository. This arrangement enhances the separation of concerns, as all the apps and libraries are placed in individual folders while using common dependencies and various tools throughout the mono repository.

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies
Rush is compatible with pnpm workspaces, which reduces unnecessary dependency installations by utilizing shared dependencies across packages. Execute:

```bash
rush install
```

This will establish a common node_modules directory and interlink an internal package (for example, auth-library) within the mono-repo.

In case the customer dashboard also needs the shared authentication library, include it in its `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@my-platform/auth-library": "*"
  }
}
```
It would take care of linking those packages correctly, ensuring that the most recent local versions are in use while developing.

### Step 3: Building and Running the Project
Rush can effectively support reusable builds—that is, a build process involves only modifications made since the last build. This is done for the benefit of keeping the CI pipeline quick.

To build all packages, execute:

```bash
rush build
```

If only the [api-gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) package was altered, Rush would know of this and rebuild that service only, saving a lot of time while developing and deploying the application.

In addition, it allows you to run tests for many packages at the same time. For instance:

```bash
rush test
```

This will execute every test described in the test scripts within the entire monorepo. In a situation where a particular library or service needs a different testing tool, Rush respects this requirement and allows those tools to be used within each package independently.

### Step 4: Publishing Changes Using Change Files
Rush distinguishes itself from other solutions by making it mandatory for its users to submit change files while making any modifications to the packages to facilitate easy tracking of updates and versioning. For instance, if the `auth-library` is modified by a developer, they will execute:

```bash
rush change
```

This command creates a change file, where the developer is free to explain what was changed or added. For instance:

```json
{
  "packageName": "auth-library",
  "changeType": "minor",
  "comment": "Added OAuth2.0 support."
}
```

These change files regularly make sure that each and every update is made and also is incorporated into the release notes.

## Performance Comparison
In the context of working with large monorepos, tools such as Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, and Rush offer interesting and distinct ways of approaching the issues of build performance and optimization, caching, and task execution, respectively. Each of these tools has its approach to incremental builds, dependency trees, and parallelism, which are primary aspects for any such large code base concerns. The table underneath summarizes the performance aspects of each tool, thus facilitating the comparison of these tools in the next section of the paper.

| Feature                 | Nx                                | Turborepo                          | Bazel                              | Rush                               | Lerna                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Incremental Builds      | Uses dependency graphs to rebuild only affected projects | Rebuilds only changed pipelines with fast caching | Rebuilds minimal targets with granular control | Incremental CI builds for large monorepos | No native support for incremental builds; relies on package managers. |
| Caching                 | Distributed caching with Nx Cloud | Local and remote caching via Turborepo Cloud | Content-addressable storage with extensive caching | Limited native caching; relies on external tools like pnpm | No caching mechanism by default. |

For Lerna:

| Feature                 | Lerna                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Incremental Builds      | It doesn't support incremental builds out of the box. Uses external package managers such as npm or Yarn to handle dependencies and scripts.|
| Caching                 | Does not have integrated caching systems. Caching has to be done using third-party tools or services, which is an additional configuration.|
| Parallel Execution      | Provides basic support for running tasks in parallel using npm/Yarn workspaces, and advanced techniques for task scheduling and prioritization are not implemented.|
| Dependency Management   | Connects internal modules with NPM or Yarn, thus easing the process of working on the project locally. This is, however, not able to manage complex dependent trees as well as Nx or Bazel can.|
| Build Times             | The reduction in performance when working with large coded applications is evident, more so in the case when there are no optimized builds in place, no caching, or task scheduling is implemented. Most preferable for smaller projects.|
| CI/CD Optimization      | Provision of basic agile DevOps support (CI/CD) primarily oriented towards publishing processes. However, it does not offer enhancements in caching or continuous integration like that of Nx or Bazel.|
| Ease of Setup           | It is easy and simple to set up, which makes it a great entry point for smaller projects or teams that are new to monorepos.|
| Developer Tools         | Has a primary emphasis on versioning and publishing processes. Missing some sophisticated developer utilities like dependency graphs or some scaffolding commands.|
| Best Use Case           | Best suited for the maintenance of package-oriented libraries, their versioning, and publishing processes. Geared towards small to moderate monorepos or JavaScript library personnel applications.|

### Verdict
Nx and Turborepo are great choices for projects that involve JavaScript and TypeScript. To begin with, Nx comes with better developer tools than Turborepo, which is more suitable for microservices and frontend-based flows. For large projects that involve multiple languages, when ease of use is a secondary target, Bazel would be the best option because of its steep learning curve. Rush is ideal in organizational use cases where maintenance and consistent updates over a long period are important. Lerna is the most appropriate tool when it comes to building and releasing libraries, but it does not have the current performance features embedded into other software, making this tool suited for small works only. In the case of most javascript/typescript teams, which tend to think about the scalability and usability concerns first, Nx is the best compromise. Nevertheless, Turborepo is still one of the solutions of choice for teams where speed and ease of use are the primary goals.

## Developer Experience
For any management of a monorepo to be successful, developer experience is key. The simplicity of installing and configuring the necessary tools, the logical flows of work, and the presence or absence of certain plugins and integrations can all have a serious impact on the productivity of a developer. In this section, we will examine how Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, Lerna, and Rush developers experience hardware and software, highlighting their strengths and challenges.

### Nx: Streamlined and Developer-Friendly
Nx puts developers first by ensuring easy onboarding and many built-in tools such as generators, dependency graphs, and code scaffolding. This command allows the developers to easily create components, services, libraries, etc.

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/react:component MyComponent --project=my-app
```
With this, tedious work is cut down, enabling the teams to spend more time on the development tasks. It is even more impressive when it comes to TypeScript support, as it works well with frontend frameworks.

The ability to visualize a dependency graph is one of the unique aspects of this tool, as it helps the developers know what parts of the monorepo are interlinked and what projects will suffer when there are changes made. Nx Cloud takes this experience one step further by including distributed caching, which also helps in rewriting progress as well as research and testing. For projects mainly working in JavaScript/TypeScript codebases, implementing daily chores becomes more fluid and well organized.

### Turborepo: Fast and Simple
Turborepo has a very simplistic approach, which resonates well with the developers constructing microservices or working around frontend-heavy monorepos. It boosts task pipelines and caching, and hence it is easy to configure task pipes that execute only where required. A developer who has previously used npm or Yarn should find Turborepo a friendly interface since it fits well into the already existing systems.

One of its strengths is the zero-config caching. Out of the box, it implements a mechanism to cache task outputs, which it will use in future builds and deployments, thus eliminating the need for redundant work. The developers do not have to go through the hassle of defining detailed and complicated caching rule sets, thanks to Turborepo, which does that all for them.

As much as Turborepo makes caching and pipelines easier, it does so at the expense of providing fewer developer tools than what Nx offers. Team members who are engaged mostly with front-end applications and are in search of a lightweight application will find Turborepo appropriate; however, those who need advanced scaffolding or dependency analysis may be required to install extra add-ons.

### Bazel: Power at the Cost of Complexity
While Bazel delivers exceptional speed on large, complicated codebases, the experience suffers from a complicated learning curve. The tool was created with more scope and performance in mind and therefore can accommodate various languages and build settings. Nevertheless, implementing Bazel involves quite a lot of details concerning its BUILD files as well as the dependency rules and configurations associated with them. There is a need for every developer to come up with a specific definition for each target, which is very tedious to those who have not grasped the concept of Bazel very well.

Bazel is very effective when it comes to supporting multiple languages and ensuring that a build process is independent of other processes within the team, thus working best for teams that can afford to use it, that is, advanced performance-oriented teams. However, most of the time developers have to gun for the training, which translates to more usage of time and especially energy for learning Bren optimization in Bazel, which reduces the satisfaction in using Bazel as that of using Nx or Turborepo, which is ideal for even smaller projects.

### Rush: Structured but Demanding
Ideal for use in corporate structures and organizations with diverse teams that are distributed over large geographical areas, Rush is fundamentally a tightly designed workflow. There are stringent policies in place that guarantee proper handling of every package and its dependencies, hence lowering the chances of conflicts occurring. While this order is quite beneficial to teams who find themselves working on complicated monorepos, it, however, makes the experience for developers rather inflexible.

Adherence to prescribed workflows is a necessity in Rush: change files must be submitted with every update, for instance. This practice enhances accountability and ensures version integrity, but also creates a bottleneck for users whose tasks are less significant in scope. Countless resources are being expanded during the installation phase as compared to other competitor tools because Rush requires the building of such things as policies, package managers, and even CI pipelines before use.

However, once all the requirements have been satisfied, it is refreshing to note that Rush does allow for a controlled and even boring mode of use, especially for organizations managing complex long-term projects with several moving parts. It works seamlessly with pnpm to optimize the amount of space used and guarantees reproducible builds in all environments, making it suitable for extended use.

### Lerna: Simplicity for Traditional JavaScript Monorepos
Lerna is undoubtedly one of the oldest tools that facilitates managing JavaScript Monorepo. It has a comparatively simpler developer experience as it is concerned with the versioning and publishing of packages available in a single repository. Lerna supports this kind of multi-package repositories along two dominant modes of operation, which are also known as the simple mode or fixed mode, where all the packages use the same version (fixed/locked mode), and the complex or independent mode, whereby all the packages have their versions (independent mode). This is useful where several libraries or services are to be released separately.

The bootstrap command of Lerna creates all the internal packages installed and linked together, so the user does not have to install even a single package manually. After all, it is very common for developers to start this way:

```bash
npx lerna bootstrap
```

This command aids in handling all the necessary third-party libraries and within-modules linking so that ease of development is enhanced when there are several related packages that need the sharing of some code parts. Lerna is also very compatible with both npm and Yarn without much configuration, making it attractive for smaller teams or fast-paced scenarios where many interrelated packages need to be maintained.

Lerna cannot be used in those complex use cases that involve caching, running tasks in parallel, or there are dependency graphs. Lerna is focused on how to carry out publishing processes rather than improving the efficiency of the building processes, which makes its applicability on extensive codes that demand construction at a very high speed austere. Whereas in the past all the developers had to use Lerna, more advanced solutions, like Nx and Turborepo, are already able to offer more functionality, performance-wise, and can be especially recommended for growing or already huge and complex applications.

## Conclusion
The selection of a monorepo management tool must correlate with the scale, intricacy, and requirements of the project/team. In this regard, Nx is a compromise solution that provides a great developer experience and allows the seamless development of JavaScript and Typescript applications. On the other hand, Turborepo is quick and straightforward, thus perfect for micro-frontend services. When it comes to large and complex codebases in different programming languages, Bazel remains the best but will need you to undergo extensive training. Rush is ideal for large organizations where there is a need for strict control of package dependencies and stability for years. At the same time, Lerna can still be used by small-scale systems, which are mostly concerned with version control and publishing, but it is not suitable for big systems. All of the tools share advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of the tool will be predicated on performance factors versus complexity factors and workflow requirements.
