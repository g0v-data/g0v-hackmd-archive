On the contrary, in many industries, demonstrating initiative in addiction treatment and a willingness to change is seen as a responsible decision. The United Recovery Project website explains that the outcome depends on a number of factors, including the rules of the specific licensing board, the presence of disciplinary violations, and the fact of voluntarily seeking help.
