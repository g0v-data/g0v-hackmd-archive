#  How to Integrate reCAPTCHA v2 into your React Login Forms

Securing login forms is a crucial part of web development today when online threats are becoming more advanced. One effective way of making your login forms more secure is by adding Google reCAPTCHA v2. This article will guide you on integrating reCAPTCHA into your React-based login forms, protecting your application from automated attacks while allowing only valid user access.

## Prerequisites
Before plunging into the amalgamation of reCAPTCHA v2 using your React login forms, have some major determinants in mind. First and foremost, you ought to have a fundamental grasp of React including generating components alongside administering state within a React application. Having prior knowledge of submission handling for forms in React will also serve as an added advantage. 

Apart from React knowledge, you have important tools that need installation and configuration. The main one is the react-google-recaptcha package which can be used as a simple means of adding reCAPTCHA for your React components. A Google account is also a must so that you get access to the Console Admin for reCAPTCHA where you can obtain the site key and the secret key necessary for reCAPTCHA integration purposes. With these prerequisites, there will be a seamless and successful integration process when securing login forms on reCAPTCHA v2.

## Setup
Integrating reCAPTCHA v2 into your React registration form will take you to an initial phase where you need to get some key from Google. First, visit the Google reCAPTCHA website, and then go to the Admin Console. If you haven’t signed in yet, sign in with a Google account. Upon arriving at this Admin Console page, registering your site is required. At this point, you must supply a name for the reCAPTCHA instance and select the specific type of reCAPTCHA that you want. For this integration you choose “reCAPTCHA v2” and click on the “I am not a robot” checkbox option. In addition, you need to include domain names where you want to use reCAPTCHA so that keys will only work on those domains. At last, accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service before making an application. Google provides two prominent codes after the completion of the registration process: site and secret key. The React application utilizes a site key for rendering a reCAPTCHA widget while on the server side, it is used to verify reCAPTCHA responses. Thus, these codes must be stored securely as they are required later during integration. You may now create your login form with reCAPTCHA as an additional security measure using your site and secret keys.

## Creating a login form
In this stage two, you will create a simple login form that will work as a base for integrating reCAPTCHA. Start by making a basic structure for your React project, ensuring there are components for the login form. The form should have important fields like username or email input and password inputs. You will create the form elements in your React component using ordinary HTML input fields. Each input should be controlled by React state enabling proper management of data in forms. For instance, `useState` hooks can help to track the username and password field values separately. Besides that, you also need a `submit` button to handle if the form is submitted properly. Once you structurally re-design this form, there is a need for a basic validation framework to ensure that users are offering up requirements. For instance, making sure that the two fields representing username and password are not left empty during submission phase of filling them out forms. If you include an `onSubmit` event handler to this form element, the processing of information used for completing the whole framework will be done.

For example:
A basic login form designed for user name and password is created using this React component:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const LoginForm = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    // Basic validation
    if (!username || !password) {
      alert('Please enter both username and password.');
      return;
    }

    // Submit form data (You can add your form submission logic here)
    console.log('Username:', username);
    console.log('Password:', password);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username or Email:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="username"
          value={username}
          onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password:</label>
        <input
          type="password"
          id="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
};

export default LoginForm;
```
This code snippet showcases a basic React component designed as a login form containing areas for inputting a username and password. The react’s useState hook that oversees states in such cases is the one being utilized; enabling it to listen to whatever is typed in. Two state variables are defined via useState in this component: username and password - which will be able to hold values for these respective fields. The functions for changing them (setUsername and setPassword) obtain their respective attributes from related text areas located within said input boxes.






Now a basic login form built with React is available which can be improved By Adding reCAPTCHA. The Next steps will require you To add reCAPTCHA in this form so that it distinguishes Humans from Bots successfully.
