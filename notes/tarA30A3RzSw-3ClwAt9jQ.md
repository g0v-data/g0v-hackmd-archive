Subject: (May 14-15, Taiwan) Call for Talks: g0v Summit

\[Greeting\],

Returning for a second year after 2014, the g0v Summit 2016 will take place in **May 14-15, 2016** at Taipei's Academia Sinica.  Call for talks is open until Feb 22: [http://g0v-summit2016.kktix.cc/events/g0v-cfp#en](http://g0v-summit2016.kktix.cc/events/g0v-cfp#en)


We are pleased to invite the global civic tech community to share their experiences for collaboration between public servants, technologists, and NGO workers.  We are pleased to have Felipe Heusser, founder and former Director of the Chilean NGO Ciudadano Inteligente and Fellow at the Berkman Center, as our keynote speaker.

g0v Summit 2014 had 43 speakers from 9 countries with diverse backgrounds, including Open Data evangelists, public servants, NPO/NGO workers, scholars, and entrepreneurs.

#### ▋ Fork and Merge


"Openness", "Transparency" and "Participation" have become popular keywords.  The global civic tech communities are experimenting with mass participation, new media forms and making better use of data,  which is essentially "forking" the government like an open source movement.  We would like to see how these processes and practices can be sustainably "merged" into daily governance, as well as having interdisciplinary conversation about these changes and impacts.

### ▋ Calling for Speakers


We would like to invite talk submissions about stories on open collaboration and civic tech, with the following topics:

．Administration
．Oversight / Participatory Democracy
．Activism and Mobilization
．New Media / Art & Design
．Crowd / Citizen Science
．Disaster / Environment
．Care and Welfare
．Education
．Anything related to Open Collaboration and Civic Tech

The session of each topic is 30 minutes. If there are many similarly themed discussion topics, we may also adjust the format to a panel.  There will also be unconference sessions for people to extend conversation.

To submit a talk in g0v Summit 2016, please go to [http://g0v-summit2016.kktix.cc/events/g0v-cfp](http://g0v-summit2016.kktix.cc/events/g0v-cfp#en)[#en](http://g0v-summit2016.kktix.cc/events/g0v-cfp#en)

The submission is open until   **February** **22.** We will notify and publish the results on February 29.  If you have any question, please contact the program committee at g0v-summit-committee-2016@googlegroups.com


#### ▋ Traveling and accommodation


We have limited funding for travel and accommodation for overseas speakers.  If you have your own funding source, we would be happy to list the funding organization as a sponsor of the event.
