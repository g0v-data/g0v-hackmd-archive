# da0 comms/social 

### Goal 
Set up tools to
* Import/export learnings from da0
* Connect with other DeSoc/DID organizations and leaders
* Inspire more g0v community to learn about da0 tools or become contributor

### Target 
We likely have 2 target audiences and will need different approaches
* **Public** - Share tweets and articles about our progress
* **g0v** - Share onboarding information and success stories to different projects

### Where 
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/da0_g0v_tw) 
* Blog (Substack or Mirror)
* Slack (to internal g0v/da0 members)

### How 
Anyone can write and publish content from da0. comms pod will set up tools available for anyone to share content. Tools can be adjusted based on our needs.

### Tools 
Substack vs Mirror 
* Mirror 
    * More web3 spirit 
    * One author listed per article 
    * No discovery 
    * Email list is hidden
* Substack
    * Can have multiple authors listed in one article
    * Own email list
    * Can automatically import podcasts 

Jacky: my personal pick is Substack, but understand others feel mirror is more web3. However should we pick the tool that works better instead of web3 for web3? 

Open to discussion, would love to hear other feedback!

    * Audience: other DeSo/DID/DAO thought leaders and global community 
    * e.g. share Plurality? our learnings, experience, declaration, get feedback from other deSoc communities in the world like RxC / OakCurrency
    * tools: twitter / blog?
    * Language: EN
* Platforms available: twitter / substack / medium / mirror / telegram / discord
