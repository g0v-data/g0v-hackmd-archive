Dear FtO participant,

Trust you are doing well back to daily life after the magic weekend in Tainan. Here’s some follow-ups from FtO organizers in Taiwan :)

## Photo album

chihao has created a [FtO Tainan 2019 Album](https://tinyurl.com/ftoalbum) for all of us to share FtO photos. Here are some important reminders about uploading and downloading the photos for further use:

* If you are going to download and use the photos from the FtO album, please check the license of the photo before doing so. The licenses used by each participant respectively is listed in the [Photo License Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14y6K737zTnMqkOmTECmXjWYkEHFWtu6u0wCfXwtRUCc/edit#gid=628453658). If there is no license for the photos from a particular person, please ask them first before downloading.

* If you already uploaded photos or about to do so, please let us know the copyright license you prefer for your photos by signing up in the [Photo License Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14y6K737zTnMqkOmTECmXjWYkEHFWtu6u0wCfXwtRUCc/edit#gid=628453658). We encourage you to use a [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) so other participants can make the most of your photos to share FtO experiences.

* If you have uploaded photos and do not want them to be published, please delete the photos from the FtO album.

* If your face or figure is photoed and you don’t want the pictures of you to be published, please inform the organizers.

## Retro

Here is a [Retro](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14y6K737zTnMqkOmTECmXjWYkEHFWtu6u0wCfXwtRUCc/edit#gid=739912923) and please give us 5 minutes of your time and leave some comments about this FtO in the sheet.

Each box can contain one of your feelings or comments.  Please pick an appropriate column for your comment.  Fresh memory is important, so let’s finish this retro before 1/4. Organizers are looking forward to seeing your comment. Your comments are very important for future events.

## Mutual respect

For this FtO, organizers in Taiwan have worked hard to make the event both fun and productive. While relaxed, there are some ground rules that we expect to be honored out of mutual respect.

It was unfortunate to see in this FtO participants who did not show up, who stayed in CAOJI without registration, or who entered FtO venue illicitly knowing that they are not registered. Organizers in Taiwan have taken appropriate actions in each of these cases, and we will work to ensure similar situations do not happen in the future. We thank you for your understanding and support.

## Keep in touch

Organizers have created an FtO Telegram group since FtO Okinawa. Many participants are already in it. If you are not and want to join, please ask a fellow participant or an organizer.

If you want to find information about FtO, please always check the [FtO Book](https://tinyurl.com/ftofto). Also, you can always reach out in the FtO Telegram group.

We are grateful to have all of you at this FtO in Tainan. It is you who made the event productive, informative, joyful, and unforgetable. Let’s keep connected and happy hacking.

See you in [FtO Jeju 2020](https://g0v.hackmd.io/LYlwU_gTSDSIv9svfsoxwA) in the spring :)
