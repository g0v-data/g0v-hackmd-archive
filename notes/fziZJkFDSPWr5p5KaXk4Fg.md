second follow-up:Is it bad if people come to hackathons just to hang out?

4) Does having fun ever limit project progress?

5) How do you think you can increase the "fun" in the community?




Sam 
sometimes I feel like to be a "real" participant you have to get past the fun, like it's only when you've stressed out and put in the time and worked through the pain on a project that you're a "real" contributor. This isn't a critique of anyone, just a pressure i've place on myself and I feel like I've seen in other people. I feel like I judge how "real" I am as a g0v contirbutor based on this. This is something I think it would be interesting to discuss. I wonder if anyone else can relate to this feeling 

Pomin Wu
can't say I relate to that feeling at all.  thus it is an interesting thing to discuss.
