# 共體時艱

## Project name
da0 soulbound incentive system
- An incentive system for g0v and civic organizations

## Project repo

## Brief project summary
Our early research indicates that the biggest momentum in civic organizations comes from project owners and initiators. These are individual with high level passions and like great talent, do not come by easily,  the key to an organization's success is to help them succeed.

We found the biggest pain point for these individuals is the fact that they lack the tools to attract others to contribute to their causes, this, we believe, can be solved by a non-tradable asset that take notes on everyone's contributions.

We want to create a non-transferrable yet fungible token for project owners to distribute to their contributors, in ways they find to be efficient. We believe this is best because project owners, being at the forefront of civic momentum, are empowered to drive progress, in the same time, a single fungible/non-transferrable token allows for easy accumulation but doesn't bring the effects of financial speculation, which can be too risky to civic organizations in terms of cultural changes.

Our very first target of experimentation is g0v, da0 is closely connected to the community with many of our members overlap with each other. We believe we have the best chance of driving changes. With a successful showcase, this opensource platforms allows for all civic organizations to take part, and drive changes.

SBT hackathons are also a big part of this plan, issuing a token is relatively easy, even with a possible new standard. But creating demand for such token (so it drives actions from contributors) would be hard, hackathons that involve internal & external builders would render cross-organization utilities, which helps all societies.

One more aspect this project is exploring is the identity and recognition part of civic movement, without financial incentives, accomplishments requires recognition, and recognition attached to identity can become a big driver for contribution.

## Describe the current status of the project and progress achieved so far
We have started our proof of concept with 6 projects inside da0, hundreds of tokens were distributed to 43 individuals who have made contributions to various projects. Operation-wise we have optimized for project owners' ease of use.

We are expanding to g0v projects in the near future.

擴大適用到 g0v 內部

## What problem(s) are being solved by within the scope of the grant?
For teams, sustainable governance.
For project owners, efficient incentive system.
And we believe these are problems being faced by all civic organizations in the world.

團隊：永續治理

## Why is your project important?
da0 is the only web3 initiative that's built upon g0v, which is considered one of the most advanced civic tech organization in the world. With the right culture and a clear field of experimentation, we think we are at the best place to explore web3 governance in the public sector. This also gives us a chance to be at the forefront of web3 public goods initiative, and we want to set an example of bringing SBT into this realm.

On the other hand civic organizations or public goods projects need alternative compensation packages to incentivize individuals, without the options of salaries and stocks, what can we do to incentivize contributions to the society? How might we build a vibrant contribution layer of society? da0's projects are important because we have a good chance of answering these questions.

## How does your project differ from similar ones?

Differences
1. Different from other hackathons : Clear target audience, g0v and contributors of society
2. Different from other g0v events：web3 focused, ability to recruit web3 coders
3. Different from other civic tech initiatives : Web3-specific, clear incentives
4. Different from general business activities：Public goods、Opensource

no similiar ones
1. 跟其他黑客松不同之處：明確場域 g0v
2. 跟其他g0v活動不同之處：web focused, 找到 g0v 以外的 builders
3. 跟其他公民科技不同之處：Web3 專門、綁定激勵機制
4. 跟商業活動不同之處：公共財、開源

## Describe how your project will result in a public good.
All infra and applications are opensource. At the same time platform is connected to all existing g0v projects.

1. 公民身份貢獻堆疊
2. SBT 實驗場，對接既有公民科技專案


## Will your results be open source?

Yes. This is an opensource SBT platform for all civic organizations

## Describe the expected effects of your project proposal on the Ethereum ecosystem.*
