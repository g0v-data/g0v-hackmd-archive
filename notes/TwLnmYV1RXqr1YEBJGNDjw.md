My cousin was prescribed some green pills for his panic attacks and I was curious about what they were since he mentioned they work really fast. Turns out they're a specific type of anti-anxiety medication that comes in different colors and strengths depending on the manufacturer. The green ones are actually pretty potent and can be dangerous if not taken exactly as prescribed. Was looking into this at https://unitedrecoveryproject.com/rehab-blog/green-xanax/ because I wanted to understand what he was dealing with and how to recognize if he might be having problems with them. Important to know the signs since these medications can be really addictive even when used properly
