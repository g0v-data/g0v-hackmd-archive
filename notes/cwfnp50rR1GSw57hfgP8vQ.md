## Here’s How You Determine Right Time for a Fresh Set of Tyres for Your Car
Since your vehicle serves you, there is a certain cost you have to pay in terms of fuel as well as car maintenance. This also requires you to go for a tyre replacement at some point of time.

On the other hand, thick tyre tread can easily prevent sharp objects from piercing into a tyre.

## How much distance has your vehicle covered?

The road significantly depletes the rubber in the tyres. The tyres on your car deteriorate as it travels a greater distance. Tyres typically begin to deteriorate after travelling 50,000 kilometres. 

Rugged roads and frequent braking can reduce a tire's life expectancy. Therefore, safe driving also guarantees longer tyre life. At most, tyres should last two to three years.

Additionally, the treads are made to disperse water and prevent a film of water from forming between the tyre and the ground, which can lead to aquaplaning and a loss of control. The ideal depth of the tread before changing the tyres is somewhere around 0.5 cm.
