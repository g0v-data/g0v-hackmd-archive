SF - Traffic and parking is gonna suck, hotel will be expensive, but it's SF.
- **GitHub** **Inc.**
    - 可以借，透過 [https://community.github.com/](https://community.github.com/) 要求。至少要一個月前送出要求。
    - 活動同時**必須要有 GitHubber 在場**，所以應該不太可能支援 24 小時活動。
> 好像要借的話要先做好event website

    - "The event should be beneficial to the community and relevant to GitHub."
    - Location requirements 全部符合，除 Parking...
> SF Parking 本來就很難搞... 上次去HTML5DevConf Parking 要 $24.5，根本搶劫
> [name=Tony T]

> 如果離大眾交通工具較近比 Parking 更好
> [name=Tony T]

> Yep the baseline is $20 per day. Carpool, everyone!
> [name=Mu-An]

> If its inside SF city, we can recommend the "zirx" app, it's only $15 for full day parking

Santa Clara - parking is easier, but far from the city (San Fran)
- **~Santa Clara Convention Center~** ~\- probably too large for us?~
    - [~http://www.santaclara.org/conventioncenter/~](http://www.santaclara.org/conventioncenter/)
    - ~it's near Hyatt Regency, easier for people flying/stay at the conf~
- **~Google~**  ~(Huang-Wei)~
    - ~pingoo: "有個 hackerspace，非員工似乎也可以用，我去了解一下。預估人數是 60 人嗎？時間是 24 小時？預計日期？"~ ~\- is it the 'maker space'?~
    - ~tonysan: thanks, Need 24x7 (可能會辦在周末?)，日期尚未確定：2015Q1...roughly~
    - ~hwchang: 似乎就是 garage(就是 Jackie 說的 maker space，我沒問到其他的，如果有其他的歡迎提供訊息)，如果是的話，似乎不太適合辦外界活動~
- **~ITRI~**  ~(Jackie) - wifi may be a concern for 30+ concurrent usage. Got ITRI as sponsor~
- **Red Rock Coffee (Castro)** 2nd whole floor 9am-7pm $1500
- **~500 startups~** ~(Jackie asks Cjin) 需要場地費~
- **~CMU SV~** ~(Lydian)~ ~學校不給借, 而且在NASA，不太方便~

    Brief introduction about g0v Hackathon:
        g0v is an active community based in Taiwan. It promotes information transparency and develops platforms/tools to lower the barrier to overlook government, so citizen could do so in an efficient and effective manner. the core value of g0v is open-source, open data and freedom of speech.

        Hackathons are crucial events amongst g0v, being held at least once every two months. g0v hackathon exchanges and incubates great ideas for those platforms and tools. It's all about kickstarting great ideas into MVP and prototypes. The good does not stop at the end of hackathon - they grow and prosper at the hand of the community.

        Most of the g0v projects are hosted under [https://github.com/g0v/](https://github.com/g0v/).  GitHub has been an indispensable tool since the start of g0v community. Recently, g0v held a Hackathon in Washington DC, we would like to start the g0v US-west Hackathon in the crux of Silicon Valley, GitHub Inc. we look forward for GitHub generously sponsoring our event.
