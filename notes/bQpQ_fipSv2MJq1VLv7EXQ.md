> [name=Pomin Wu] Just trying to understand a little more about the event: I think it's safe to say that "democracy" is a big word with many meanings, of which many are or has been in practice in g0v community.  What is the term "digital democracy" referring to in the context of this discussion?  Why is it important?  Is there an "absence" of art from digital democracy?  Why is it a problem?  Why is the problem not the other way around, aka absence of democracy from new media art?
