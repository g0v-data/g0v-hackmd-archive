# Open-Licensed, Digital-Governance Research funded through the UN - Please Help, Deadline 2nd Sept!


I am a research associate with the CityScienceLab in Hamburg. I am in development of a research project with the working title 'Urban Consensus'. This project deals with understanding youth urban governance in middle- to low-income countries in cities with populations under one million. 
Ben 主要研究領域為『城市共識』期望於『中、低階收入國家，且城市規模小於一百萬』的年輕城市治理

The goal is to create a DAO governance strucutre and utilise various civic technologies to collaborate with and empower young citizens in these regions.
其目的期望建立一個DAO組織治理架構，並運用多元城市科技技術與年輕的市民合作與賦權。

I have a strong interest in the digital democratic movement in Taiwan. I'm trying to understand the plurality of actors, groups and technologies that have shaped what some are calling 'The Taiwan Model' of democracy. My focus is on the Urban Aspects of this. YOUR opinion is important to me. All answers will be taken as an individual response.
Ben 對於台灣的數位民主進程有相當大的興趣，亦企圖理解台灣民主進程中的多元角色、團體以及科技治理如何形塑我們所稱的『台灣模式』的民主，並聚焦於此議題的『城市觀點』。
任何回應都相當感謝。
我是與Ben 一起共事的台灣人，您可以留英文或中文，我願意幫忙協助翻譯，也歡迎大家一起討論
