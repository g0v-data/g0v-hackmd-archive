Billab on RGBA
- Immutable initial entry data
- Each “fork” makes it a new branch with a specific tag
- Forks can introduce new list items, delete items, and/or change texts in the existing items
- Master list shows a foldable view of all edited lists under an entry
- Each fork can cherry-pick another fork’s changes
- Each item (forked or not) allows discussions, poetica-style
