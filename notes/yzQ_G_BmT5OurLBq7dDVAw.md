# Asia Young Activist Researcher Fellowship (AYARF)

[via lead coordinator of AYARF]

AYARF is a 10-day residency program in Seoul, South Korea from 5th of January to 15th of January 2020.

- Date: 5th of Jan. to 15th of Jan., 2020
- Venue: Seoul Innovation Park and around Seoul (An inspiring weekend trip is on planning)
- Key Participants: 20 new AYARF Fellows (15 Faculty members and Speakers)

AYARF would like to support the youth who discover and define the social issue actively, take actions to address it and distribute its results so that the world gets better with positive impact. The fellow doesn’t have to hold Master’s or Ph.D.’s but a high willingness to adopt the new ideas and research tools and be connected with the people who can stand together for the social issues we care about and take action together. We call them Activist Researchers.

The first AYARF program in this coming January is seeking for the first 20 fellows of AYARF. Please find more information from [file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pCxjnRrWjnu-T9cRKZ2xjO5wb5825CsB) or [AYARF website](https://www.ayarf.net/).
