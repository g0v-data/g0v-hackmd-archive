# Interview Request - article on FNF Homepage

# Intro

Dear g0v-ers,

I hope this finds you well, safe and healthy!

I am approaching you today with a request: I am planning a little series of articles on civic tech around the world. I woild like to publish it at our website freiheit.org. Questions that interest me: What are the approaches taken in different countries? What works, what does not? Why are things working which are working in a specific context? This sort of questions.

My idea is to write short articles about the different cases, based on a short interview. I would also like to have some quotes in the text if possible.

I was wondering if you would be willing to answer some questions for me?

I have compiled a short list of questions (find them below) - I know that they are quite a few and some of them will probably take more than two sentences to answer. I would like to be mindful of your time and resources, so if answering all of the questions is too much, it is fine if you skip a question.

Once I get your answers, I would proceed to write the article and would then send it to you once it is done for final approval, especially for the quotes.

If you have any questions regarding my article series, the questions or anything else - please do feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you and best regards from Berlin!

Anna


# Questions

* Tell me about your collective – who are you, how do you work, what are your goals, what topics are most important to you?
* What is your approach to civic tech?
* Has COVID 19 changed anything regarding the use/acceptance/interest in civic tech?
* Has people’s perception on civic tech changed? (They are more interested, less interested because they have other things to worry about…)
* Where do you see the limitations of civic tech? It seems to me that civic tech is often being hailed as the solution to all problems (especially by politicians who don’t understand it) – is there a topic/an area where you would say – no, civic tech cannot be helpful here? 
* What civic tech project of yours has, in your opinion, worked really well? Why?
* What project has not worked out? Why? 
* What are the strengths of civic tech? Which possibility is most underrated?
* Why do you think is Taiwan so advanced in adopting and creating civic tech? What is different 
* One of the hopes that are resting on civic tech is, that it engages citizens and makes them feel heard and thereby strengthens democracy. When it comes to technical solutions of any kind, there is often a fear here in Europe, that older people will be represented/excluded because they are not that tech savy. Is that something that you notice with your projects? Are there mainly young-ish people participating? If not – are older people (say 65 and above) in Taiwan well versed in using smartphones and computers? How is the participation rate of the Taiwan indigenous people? 
* In your opinion, is civic tech something that governments can implement, or is it something that has to emerge from society? 
* Is there anything specific that you would like me to mention?
