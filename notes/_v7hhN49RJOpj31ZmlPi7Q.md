Started playing online blackjack seriously around six months ago after learning basic strategy from some guides. Tried a few different platforms but settled on [Dragon Slots blackjack](https://dragonslots.com/live-casino/live-blackjack) because the overall setup just works better. Tables load quickly and the dealers know what they're doing which sounds basic but I've had bad experiences elsewhere with confused dealers slowing everything down. You can play multiple hands at once if you want which I do sometimes when the table isn't too crowded. The betting range is flexible so whether I'm playing cautious or feeling confident I can find a comfortable stake level. Other players at the table are usually cool and sometimes give advice in chat if you're unsure about a decision. Honestly the main thing is just consistency and this platform delivers that without random technical problems interrupting your session. Insurance and side bets are available if you want those options though I typically skip them. Been having regular sessions without any complaints and my win rate seems fair based on how I'm playing. Solid choice if blackjack is your game and you want a reliable place to play it live
