## Velix Vernando Wanggai (Indonesia)
Q: (to TW) network of ngo to improve political awareness

Q: (KR) political campaign $ limitation?

political fund limit varies from national/local

public funding from NEC to qualified parties
oligated to report
carrot and stick

Q: (IN) how to deal with diverse social settings and regions?

indonesia is a very big market for election

inequality not only in economy and gender, but also right to vote and become candidate

difficulty in basic inform
hoax, fake news

hackathons create democracy defendants

Q: (IN) openness of political parties

KPU has authority to push parties to be open
1. make sure 1 person 1 party member
2. must publish campaign funds

gov give money to party for political education (?) for constituents
no authority to push for them to be open on this

Q: (IN) Titi wearing political party color?

## GJ KIM (Korea)
Q: (To KR) Digital election; NEC prototyping blockchain-based election, what is the blueprint of digital election? More future please.

Aside from public elections
NEC also manages municiple elections, "autonomous leaders" (university, schools, orgs) entrust their electiont to NEC => "entrusted election"

NEC's strategy expand authority to other elections

if we have more elections, public elections can be better

In entrusted elections, use cellphone to vote
2004 electronic voting, did not get public trust
use cellphone for college, municiple elections

use blockchain yes
but not general yet

## Oscar (Indonesia)
Q: how does tech adapt classical election process?
Q: open data, what next?

blockchain, not so much
literacy!
