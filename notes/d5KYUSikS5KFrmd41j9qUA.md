分享會簡易英文文播

[PROCEDURAL NOTICE: given broadcaster scheduling constraints, primary text broadcast will end by 21:30 Taipei time.]

## 0. Intro
IFF and TICTeC are both prominent events which address contemporary tech and internet issues.

## 1. Aiya / OCF - TICTeC & IFF (via remote link)
  - TICTeC is a annual conference, which targets researchers in ciciv tech and is a major event in this area, where latest tech development, case studies concentrate. This is likely exclusively on only designated civic tech conference, and venue rotate between years.
  - A "good kids" conference: where case studies and new tech developments are introduced in a organized, structured manner. Compared to IFF, TICTeC is conducted in a more academic language (elitist?). IFF in comparison leans more toward activism and the underground.
  - This year's venue was held in OECD premises, with keynote speeches and sturcutred events. This is also an event in which networking is a major part--to some more important than the event program.
  - Case Study encounter: 4 cases of participatory budget in 4 different cities. Comparisons were made in terms of perception and expectations. Results indicated that the application of PB may even erode democracy in some instances, but the overall primary objective is always to increase civic awareness.
  - Ttcat and Isabel from g0v were also part of the delegation, the latter was the only East Asian female speaker at the event. Official report of the entire TICTeC is also uploaded.

## 2. Ttcat / g0v participant/collaborator - TICTeC & IFF
3 cases [only had time for 1]

### Civic tech field guide by CIVIC HALL:
- ethnographic catalogue of civic technology in different countries. Timeline included.
- over 25 years, 3 areas (tech, social, periphery)
- why do this? to determine whether the field has grown and whether it's still growing, whether available data is useful
- 1990s: a lot of the funders that are active now where established then. This is not a coincidence. the browser MOSIAC helped with the proliferation of internet beyond academic circles; significant instances of application (senator campaign website, city and national govenment digitization, google)
- 2000s: civic data and civic minded tech, emergence of social media; e.g.: They Work for You (open source MP performance tracking), google map API release, Code for America (bureaucracy tech)
- 2010s: knowledge based tech (media related); emergence of "civic" designation; (Note: 2012 g0v establishment)
- A decline in experimentation? e.g. inclination of themed hackathon and exclusively civic tech oriented organization--funding more selective OR database methodology issue
- prospect: high-tech (AI, AR, drones, blockchainkcha) emergence and consolidation

### Toosheh
- Iranian satellite broadcast of digital content, catered toward combatting censorship, poverty and refugee digitial gap. In practice, increasing demand in knowledge based content.

## 3. Isabel / g0v-intl - TICTeC
- 2000 participation began in open source community
- three things
    - why go?
    - what gained?
    - what to do with it?
- Why go?
    - to share speech at g0v summit with international audience
    - organizer mySociety is a close collaborator with g0v
    - tech company sponsor presentations (uneven standard)
    - sporadic publication of session recording/material
    - disinformation cases: 
        - [Full Fact](https://twitter.com/FullFact)(UK) factcheck tools combining deep learning and journalism
        - facebook: indentification of disinformation possibility, transparency of political ads, responses (within 12 hrs in US midterm election); identification not via content but via channels of proliferation; majority from Russia/Eastern Europe; planned expansion to other countries (TW not a planned destination, although there's method to accuratly identify constituents)
    - my topic at tictec: “legal stories of g0v” 20 min, 40 slides
        - I spoke about the "structure" of g0v -- which is without a structure. g0v is not a foundation
        - how is finance handled?
        - Many organization started this way, but slowly closing in terms of governments and maintanence
        - g0v is fortunate to have outside support from OCF
        - at tictec, ppl can't really tell the relationship between g0v and ocf
        - I asked "who has heard of g0v", half hasn't heard of g0v
        - I feel that we need to clarify this
        - I feel that the g0v community hasn't been spending enough energy at international exchanges
        - Before I went to tictec, some of us g0v contributors has started to talk about "open international exchanges"
        - Hopefully communities would have the capacity to promote their own projects and seek their own funding in the future
        - We are hosting a okinawa hackathon with the Japanese and Korean community, enrollment is still open! (no free accommodation I'm afraid)
        - Please vote for the g0v-intl session at COSCUP

```
(sorry... indentation crazy...)
you're good. thanks for the hand! \m/
\hand/ \hand/ \hand/
```

## 4. Lulu / OCF - IFF
- indeed it's difficult to distinguish betwween g0v and ocf.
- OCF serves to facilitate communities in international exchanges and fundraising
- full time staff is always available => that's a plus, enables more continuous exchanges
- Internet Freedom Festival
    - a hackers' "woodstock"
    - code of conduct of primary significance: many participants are considered dissendants domestically, for whom exposure presents danger to the person. Privacy/obscurity is a major point.
    - Default closed. Photograph no one unless explicitly consented.
    - "Don't forget about the glitter!!!" (powder)
    - All communications are with bubbles (wtf)
    - The objective is to create a safe, comfortable and secure environment for activist exchanges
    - kind of a decompress retreat for the stressful hackers and anti-gov workers???
    - program: often none and/or freewheeling
    - VPN/Tor: do not obscure the act of serfing, only obscure the content
    - tor: random 3 nodes before connecting to target
    - not "totally secret"
    - they know that you're using it, just can't see what you're looking at. `dumb translation lol -> @gj kim: haha no worries at all. you've been helping my understanding a lot! `
    - kill swtich is vital: if default is to continued internet connection after VPN/Tor disconnection, IP/user would be exposed
    - (an extra introductory session about Taiwan)
    - a general perception at IFF: a cyber-based progressive activists event
    - OCF international exchanges are all public and welcome futher feedback



## 5. Ho / Taiwan Association for Human Rights - IFF
 - An evnet oriented more toward civic activists; with RIGHTSCON participants come from all background and sectors and arguments/confrontations may occur, where IFF is closer to a like-minded networking event
 - TAHR organized a panel on government surveillance ("mapping"); panelists both from Venezuela where domestic situation makes it logistically difficult to deliver; another panelist from Chile; VEN: gov't collection of rally participants, followed by harrassment and detention, e-voting biometric authentication method exploited for political profiling, etc.; Chile utilizes drone and baloons with facial recognition in the name of security
 - Who supplies the tech/hardware? the "surveillance industry" may be a mapping option
 - 2 panels addressed digital ID:
     - India fingerprint ID database (unconstitutional, API connected to private sector [participant comment] database authentication process excessively intrusive in terms of personal data)
     - (by Accessnow) centralized ID systems attemtps by various countries lack sound legal framework and often include biometric identification
     - Recently UN organizations seemed closer to the side of regulators
 - Facial recognition: in practice TW police also uses a similar system; investigation reveals that possibility exist to implement CCTV facial recognition, access also concerningly excessive
 - a group counseling session/panel

## 6. Afi / Hsintien Stay Association - IFF
 - a distictively positive perception in CN on internet surveillance
 - visit to Valencia government's "transparency department" (anti-corruption)

## 7. Reke / Wikipedia Taiwan - IFF
 - an accusation at IFF against CN hostile nationalism that disrupts Wikipedia, which in the speech was attached to US-CN trade war
 - Dealing with trolls
     - trolls are sometimes government sponsored; identification requires observation of operation patterns (not content), e.g. user IDs active periods.
     - role of platform: clash between reality and ideal (whether they "should" address the issue and whether any measure/lobbying effort by communities would be effective)
     - booths: "dissident travel security checklist"
 - internet and gender
     - feminist priciples of the internet (access, available content, etc.)--technical protocol incorporation (difficult: IETF inefficient, instead address the protocol themselves may be an option)
     - IFF itself conscious of gender orientation and inclinations
     - colonization/christianity polarized gender in PHI; in Vietnam gender stereotypes less rigid given CN traditional cultural influence
