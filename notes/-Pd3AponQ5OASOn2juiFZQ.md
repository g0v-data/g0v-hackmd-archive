# Yew: A Top Rust Front-end Framework in 2024
With optimal performance and safety aims, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is increasingly utilized in website creation, including the front end. The landscape is mainly occupied by [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) frameworks such as [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Angular](https://angular.dev/); however, contrary to their dominance, there are also various Rust-based front-end frameworks. The high performance levels they boast of, together with their strong typing capacities and memory safety guarantees make them an excellent choice for constructing contemporary web apps.

In 2024, various Rust front-end frameworks have distinct features and capabilities. The article highlights several Rust front-end frameworks specifically [Yew](https://yew.rs/), [Seed](https://seedframework.com/), [Percy](https://chinedufn.github.io/percy/), [Sauron](https://docs.rs/sauron), and [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/). Developers need to select among these tools as per their requirements thus the article provides an elaborate comparison of these frameworks including their strengths weaknesses and use cases. Furthermore, we will address how front-end developers can incorporate this framework with existing tools and enhance performance in web applications.

## What's Yew?
Yew is an incredibly versatile tool that allows web developers to craft their front-end projects on the web using Rust and WASM. By way of compiling rust into WASM, it enables there design of excellent speed web apps resembling desktop applications when it comes to episode processing rates. Such an approach takes advantage of the following features inherent to Rust: a strong type system, a focus on safety, and concurrent programming. One of the most prominent things about Yew is that it’s component-based architecture; just as in some other frameworks like React. With this kind of approach, developers can build components that are reusable and encapsulated within themselves, meaning they take care of their state on their own and also respond to user events. Furthermore, Yew utilizes a declarative syntax for specifying user interfaces which is natural and similar to HTML making it possible for Rust developers to link their code directly with what will be displayed on screen.

There are a few things that make Yew a winning proposition. First, the language relies on Rust’s strict type system to catch a number of mistakes in advance of program execution. This leads to highly reliable and robust applications. Second, it uses Rust’s async/await feature along with multi-threading to be able to retrieve and handle data in a better way. Also, Yew allows seamless interoperability with JavaScript. This implies that developers can invoke JavaScript functions and merge the current JavaScript libraries into their Rust codes enabling a broad array of web technologies that accompany Rust. Selecting Yew is very exciting to those who know Rust already and want to manage their abilities in front end development. Besides being a good choice for projects requiring high-speed performance and dependability; because it employs WebAssembly, its execution is fast while at the same time ensuring an error-free application behavior.

## Setting Up the Environment for a Yew Project
To begin using Yew for front-end development, it is important to set up your development environment. This process entails installing the necessary tools and dependencies that are needed for Yew applications to be built and run.

First and foremost, make sure that Rust is installed on your machine. Rust is a systems programming language characterized by its high-performance levels and safe nature, which makes it indispensable while compiling Yew apps for WebAssembly. The installation of Rust can be done in several ways:

* Launch a terminal and execute the installation command for Rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
This command will download and install Rust including the `cargo` package manager that is used to manage Rust projects and their dependencies.

* After installation, ensure that Rust and `cargo` are available in your terminal by checking their versions:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```
* The next action you have at hand is to install wasm-pack, which is a tool designed to assist in the building of Rust-generated WebAssembly packages. It streamlines the compilation of Rust program files into WebAssembly modules and makes them ready for use with websites and applications developed in Internet-based platforms. By executing this command, you can get wasm-pack installed:
```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
```
In addition, you will need `trunk` - which is a build tool for various Rust projects that takes care of building and bundling Yew applications. Besides, Trunk serves your application locally for development purposes. To install trunk, use this command:
```bash
cargo install trunk
```
If you have installed Rust, `wasm-pack`, and `trunk` now it’s the right time to begin creating your new Yew project. In this case, this includes making a new Rust package, including Yew as one of its dependencies and setting it up for WebAssembly.

## Creating a New Yew Project
The setup of your environment for development marks the beginning of starting a new Yew project. In doing so, you will create a new Rust project, including Yew as a dependency, and setting up your project for WebAssembly compatibility. The following detailed instructions will help you begin:

* Create a New Rust Project: To get things underway, you’ll want to create a fresh Rust project utilizing Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build system. Open the terminal at hand and type out this command:

```bash
cargo new yew_example --bin
```
It creates a new folder called `yew_example`. In this folder, there is the basic structure for a Rust project. This happens because you provided a command line option named --bin which tells it we want to create an executable rather than a library.

Enter into your project directory by typing:
```bash
cd yew_example
```

* Add Yew Dependencies: After that, you will have to insert Yew and other dependencies related to it in your project. Locate Cargo.toml in the main directory of your project. This file is where you mention all the dependencies for your Rust project.
To include Yew and its related libraries, type these lines below the section labeled ‘[dependencies]’:

```rust
[dependencies]
yew = "0.20" # Replace with the latest version if necessary
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"
```
`yew` is the Yew framework proper. `wasm-bindgen` is the library facilitating communication between Rust and JavaScript. `wasm-bindgen-futures` is a support for asynchronous operations in WebAssembly.

* Configure the Project for WebAssembly: It is important to adjust the `Cargo.toml` file by specifying crate type as `cdylib` to generate WebAssembly modules for your project.

You should add this configuration in `Cargo.toml`:
```rust
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[package]
name = "yew_example"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name"]
edition = "2018"
```
In the `[lib]` section, a dynamic library `(cdylib)` that can be utilized with WebAssembly is stipulated as an output. The `[package]` section contains your project’s metadata.

* Write Yew Code: Let’s start off by creating a simple Yew component for testing purposes. Erase the contents of src/main.rs and put in these words:
```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

#[function_component(App)]
fn app() -> Html {
    html! {
        <div>
            <h1>{ "Hello, Yew!" }</h1>
            <p>{ "Welcome to your first Yew app." }</p>
        </div>
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<App>();
}
```

This code provides a simple Yew component named App which displays a simple message: "Hello, Yew!". The `main` function initializes the Yew application and attaches the App component to the `DOM`.


## Building a To-Do-List with Yew
This section will practically demonstrate how to use Yew in building web applications.

### Project Structure
When constructing a to-do task application with the Yew framework, it is important to arrange the frame of your project conveniently. This will assist in arranging dissimilar sections of your application and maintaining the codebase clean. The following is a recommended structure for your Yew project:

A `src` folder that contains all source files will exist in your main project directory. Within the `src` directory will be a `main.rs` file, which serves as the entry point of your application, and a components directory to hold all Yew components forming your application.

This file called `main.rs` is the first file in the Rust application and is responsible for bootstrapping a Yew app. Typically, this file contains the `main` function that calls `yew::start_app::();`, where Model is your `root` component.

Here is an example of what the `main.rs` file might look like:
```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

mod components;

struct Model;

impl Component for Model {
    type Message = ();
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self
    }

    fn update(&mut self, _: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <components::TodoList />
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<Model>();
}
```
This coding example tells you how to create a simple Yew application using the Rust programming language. It shows you how to get started with and proceed through a basic web application’s rendering process. First, it loads important components from the `yew::prelude` module that are required in Yew programs such as the Component characteristic and `html! macro`. The code also has a section called `components` that will have other components such as `TodoList`. This format allows for better handling of different sections of an application.

The `Model` struct constitutes the main part of the application. This simple example shows that an empty `Model` struct can merely serve as a placeholder for it. In defining how Yew components work, the Component trait is put into practice in the `Model` struct. The implementation entails a few methods: The `create` method initializes the component. The parameters supplied are for properties and component links, however, since the `Model` component does not need any properties or messages this method will just return an instance of Model.

The `update` method carries out the updates to the component. Nevertheless, even though the Message type is set as a unit type (()), thereby implying that it does not manage specific messages, the procedure returns true for the component to be remade any time there are updates.

The change method is called when the properties of the component change. Since properties are unit type (()), it returns false, meaning the component does not need to be redrawn for this property sort of changes.

The view method creates the user interface of a component. It defines how its HTML layout will look like using Yew’s html! macro. Here it uses TodoList which is just one of the main components within the components module.

Here is an example of what the `components/todo_list.rs` file might look like:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

struct TodoList {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    tasks: Vec<String>,
    input_value: String,
}

enum Msg {
    AddTask,
    UpdateInput(String),
}

impl Component for TodoList {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self {
            link,
            tasks: vec![],
            input_value: String::new(),
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::AddTask => {
                if !self.input_value.is_empty() {
                    self.tasks.push(self.input_value.clone());
                    self.input_value.clear();
                }
            }
            Msg::UpdateInput(value) => self.input_value = value,
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <input type="text" value=&self.input_value
                    oninput=self.link.callback(|e: InputData| Msg::UpdateInput(e.value)) />
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::AddTask)>{ "Add" }</button>
                <ul>
                    { for self.tasks.iter().map(|task| html! { <li>{ task }</li> }) }
                </ul>
            </div>
        }
    }
}
```
By structuring your Yew project this way, you’ll have clearly defined responsibilities and a tidy, maintainable codebase. Each component handles one aspect of the application’s functionality; hence, it is more manageable and extendable when necessary.

### Creating Components
Creating components is a core aspect of developing applications with a Rust front-end framework like Yew. Components encapsulate the logic, state, and rendering of UI elements, promoting code reuse and modular design.


To create a component in Yew, you define a struct to represent the component and implement the Component trait for it. This trait requires you to define methods for creating the component, updating it, changing its properties, and rendering its view.

Here's an example of creating a simple counter component in Yew:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

struct Counter {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    count: i32,
}

enum Msg {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}

impl Component for Counter {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self { link, count: 0 }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Increment => self.count += 1,
            Msg::Decrement => self.count -= 1,
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::Increment)>{ "+1" }</button>
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::Decrement)>{ "-1" }</button>
                <p>{ self.count }</p>
            </div>
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<Counter>();
}
```
The following is an example where Counter is used to represent the component while `Msg enum` defines its possible messages (events) that can be handled by this component. Here, the Component trait has been implemented for Counter such that the `create` method initializes the component; the `update` method handles state changes depending on messages; the `change` method handles property changes and the `view` method defines the HTML structure of the component.

Through this framework, developers can make complex user interfaces out of simple yet reusable building blocks. This modular way of doing things helps keep maintenance costs low and systems that use them easier to scale. Moreover, composing components together means higher levels of such interfaces can be built which improves the chances of reusing code and minimizes redundancy.

### Building the UI
The user interface (UI) is one of the most critical steps in web application development using Rust front-end frameworks like Yew. Each framework has its tools and abstractions for defining and managing the visual elements and their interactions in a structured and efficient way.

In Yew, the UI is constructed using `html!` macro that enables you to define HTML-like syntax right inside your Rust code. This technique is akin to JSX present in React, allowing an easy mixture of HTML and Rust together. The `html!` macro aids in building up the structure of the UI by composing various components as well as handling user interactions through event callbacks.

Let’s say you want to create a basic to-do list application. The essential UI components are an input field for adding new tasks, a button for submitting tasks, and a list for showing the tasks. You describe these components in the `view` method of the Yew component:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

struct TodoList {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    tasks: Vec<String>,
    input_value: String,
}

enum Msg {
    AddTask,
    UpdateInput(String),
}

impl Component for TodoList {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self {
            link,
            tasks: vec![],
            input_value: String::new(),
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::AddTask => {
                if !self.input_value.is_empty() {
                    self.tasks.push(self.input_value.clone());
                    self.input_value.clear();
                }
            }
            Msg::UpdateInput(value) => self.input_value = value,
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <input type="text" value=&self.input_value
                    oninput=self.link.callback(|e: InputData| Msg::UpdateInput(e.value)) />
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::AddTask)>{ "Add" }</button>
                <ul>
                    { for self.tasks.iter().map(|task| html! { <li>{ task }</li> }) }
                </ul>
            </div>
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<TodoList>();
}
```
In this particular instance, the method for viewing specifies the elements of the user interface (UI): an input space for task, an option button that adds it, and a catalog for displaying tasks. The user input is documented by the `oninput` event after which it updates the state of the component but when clicking on it, task addition to the list is done through `onclick` event.

### Adding Functionality
With the user interface (UI) set up, the following phase involves incorporating functions into your to-do list app. This encompasses executing systematizations for regulating users’ interactions, state management, and UI adjustments as a result of variations in the application data.

In a to-do list application, adding new tasks, marking completed tasks, and removing some tasks stand out as key functionalities. For these tasks to be done there is a need to define event handlers which will automatically update or modify the state of an application thus causing it to be re-rendered.

In Yew, you add functionality via messages that it handles and updates the state. Any interaction made by users such as clicking on some buttons or typing into input fields produces a message that the component gets to deal with. The `update` method of the component takes care of these messages and modifies the state.

For instance, extending the existing TodoList component will allow us to add functionality for marking tasks as complete or removing them:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

struct TodoList {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    tasks: Vec<Task>,
    input_value: String,
}

struct Task {
    description: String,
    completed: bool,
}

enum Msg {
    AddTask,
    UpdateInput(String),
    ToggleComplete(usize),
    RemoveTask(usize),
}

impl Component for TodoList {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self {
            link,
            tasks: vec![],
            input_value: String::new(),
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::AddTask => {
                if !self.input_value.is_empty() {
                    self.tasks.push(Task {
                        description: self.input_value.clone(),
                        completed: false,
                    });
                    self.input_value.clear();
                }
            }
            Msg::UpdateInput(value) => self.input_value = value,
            Msg::ToggleComplete(index) => {
                if let Some(task) = self.tasks.get_mut(index) {
                    task.completed = !task.completed;
                }
            }
            Msg::RemoveTask(index) => {
                self.tasks.remove(index);
            }
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <input type="text" value=&self.input_value
                    oninput=self.link.callback(|e: InputData| Msg::UpdateInput(e.value)) />
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::AddTask)>{ "Add" }</button>
                <ul>
                    { for (index, task) in self.tasks.iter().enumerate() {
                        html! {
                            <li>
                                <input type="checkbox" checked=task.completed
                                    onclick=self.link.callback(move |_| Msg::ToggleComplete(index)) />
                                { &task.description }
                                <button onclick=self.link.callback(move |_| Msg::RemoveTask(index))>{ "Remove" }</button>
                            </li>
                        }
                    }}
                </ul>
            </div>
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<TodoList>();
}
```
In this instance, we make use of the Task `struct` that depicts single tasks alongside their respective details as well as how far along they are in terms of execution. Furthermore, new messages concerning task completion toggle have been added to the `Msg enumeration`, and those related to task exclusion have been included. These new message types have also been integrated into the update function so that it takes into consideration changes in task completion status or exclusion from lists. In terms of toggling tasks’ completion status or getting rid of them altogether, the `view` method now contains extra user interface elements

### Managing State
State management is very important for any dynamic web application so that the UI shows the current data and reacts to user actions. Rust front-end frameworks like Yew provide several different methods for effectively handling state which take advantage of the strong typing and memory safety features that are associated with Rust.

A to-do list application has a state that mainly comprises the lists of tasks as well as other data related to the user interface (UI) such as input field values There are proper ways in which one can handle his or her state by keeping track of your current tasks, adding new ones marking them completed, or even deleting those from the list.

In Yew, the control of state is handled within the structure of the component. You create it as attribute fields in your struct and react to changes through messages. Therefore, the update method will process the messages for updates, which will consequently change state thus prompting re-rendering before they appear on the screen.

For instance, if you would like to manage states in a Yew to-do list application:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

struct TodoList {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    tasks: Vec<Task>,
    input_value: String,
}

struct Task {
    description: String,
    completed: bool,
}

enum Msg {
    AddTask,
    UpdateInput(String),
    ToggleComplete(usize),
    RemoveTask(usize),
}

impl Component for TodoList {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self {
            link,
            tasks: vec![],
            input_value: String::new(),
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::AddTask => {
                if !self.input_value.is_empty() {
                    self.tasks.push(Task {
                        description: self.input_value.clone(),
                        completed: false,
                    });
                    self.input_value.clear();
                }
            }
            Msg::UpdateInput(value) => self.input_value = value,
            Msg::ToggleComplete(index) => {
                if let Some(task) = self.tasks.get_mut(index) {
                    task.completed = !task.completed;
                }
            }
            Msg::RemoveTask(index) => {
                self.tasks.remove(index);
            }
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <input type="text" value=&self.input_value

                            <li>

The state of the application together with tasks and current input value are managed by the `TodoList` struct in this example. The update method which modifies the state deals with different messages such as: adding new tasks, updating the input box, toggling task completion, and removing tasks. Each time there are any changes in the state, a re-render is triggered, making sure that the UI reflects its recent updates.

### Running and Building the Application
Following the construction of the to-do list program, the next actions include executing and compiling it in confirmation of its proper working and readiness for production. This stage entails establishing a build environment, verifying its operation through local testing as well as making arrangements for deployment.

Firstly, check whether all dependencies are appropriately included in the `Cargo.toml` file. This document outlines the libraries and versions necessary to compile Rust code and create WebAssembly (Wasm) binaries.

The next step is to install a local application. This will entail converting Rust code into WebAssembly and hosting it online for development purposes. For doing this, one can either choose `trunk` or `wasm-pack` as their tools of choice. As an illustration, a `trunk` is commonly utilized in Yew-based projects. To begin with, one must install the `trunk` via cargo using a `cargo install trunk`. Thereafter, one runs the command `trunk build` which is responsible for compiling the rust files including all necessary dependencies used by the program itself. For testing purposes, however, you need to start up a local server by executing the command `trunk serve`. In addition, it opens a developing server that runs the application in a web browser and watches over changes made to the codebase while restarting if necessary.

Output:



Discerning whether an application operates appropriately entails engaging with it to test all conceivable functionalities. Therefore, this incorporates ensuring that the UI updates correctly, checking realistic interactions among its components and determining if such works as intended and also verifying that it works alongside any associated backend features.

Once you have validated that indeed it is functional, it will now be prepared for production. The process involves making the output of the build more efficient in size and speed. Hence by using the `trunk build` command optimized structures are generated that are fit for utilization. To deploy it, you must upload the files produced in the `dist` directory (which is created by `trunk build`) to your web host. This can be done through transferring files to a web server, configuring a [CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cdn/#:~:), or executing deployment on platforms such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).


## What It Can Do
A Todo list application created with the Yew framework has multiple benefits, this is, for instance, the possibility of having full CRUD implementation where users can create new to-dos, view their current ones, update them, or delete them when they are no longer needed. To add a new item you simply need to provide an input field along with a button for submitting your task. Each todo will be displayed in the app together with its text and completion status while they can be altered or removed using interactive controls provided within the interface.


One of the things that makes Yew’s user interface reactive is its use of an effective virtual DOM. Thus, only areas of the DOM that have changed will be updated as the application state changes. Therefore, both user interface and handling are very fast and responsive making it have negligible performance cost.


Yew builds on Rust’s robust type system and safety amenities to improve the dependability of your software program. The type system in Rust assists in catching possible mistakes early while compiling therefore decreasing the chances of bugs that might occur during execution. Also, it is Rust’s ownership paradigm that helps in avoiding memory problems like null pointer dereferences or buffer overflows. Moreover, multi-threading is supported by Rust’s concurrency model which can prove useful for advanced applications.

Compiling your Yew application into WebAssembly (Wasm) makes it run almost like a native application on the web. There is an increasing tendency for machines to run webassembly just as fast as they do their language, this enhances user experience overall. Additionally, if there are any existing libraries needed for your application then you can utilize them because of its interoperability with javascript. Different platforms and browsers enjoy similar levels of performance since WebAssembly has one general binary format.

## What It Cannot Do
There are a few drawbacks to Yew despite the many advantages. The number of frameworks designed specifically for Yew is limited compared to JavaScript, so you may have fewer libraries and tools in your project. This may make it beforehand hard for you to find pre-made solutions that address particular requirements or functionalities. In contrast, Yew usually requires a longer learning period than more popular JavaScript frameworks alongside Rust. Therefore, developers who are just starting with Rust may encounter some difficulties in terms of onboarding since they need to learn about new ownership and borrowing concepts which tend to be rather strict.

The smallness of the community surrounding Yew as compared to older frameworks could lead to a lack of community support and reduced resources like tutorials or forums. This smaller community may affect the amount of assistance and common knowledge provided. Moreover, Yew has limited natively supported advanced features such as server-side rendering available in other frameworks. In case your project has extensive third-party integrations and complex server-side operations, you might require alternative solutions or extra mechanisms.

## Yew vs React
Between the Yew framework using Rust and React, a prominent JavaScript framework, a number of dissimilarities and similarities can be noted down. Advantages offered by Yew include quintessential type safety and WebAssembly almost near-native speed, while React which has matured owing to its vast community support, extensive set of tools, and ecosystem. Hence, performance needs, language preferences as well as individual project requirements may affect choosing either Yew or React.
