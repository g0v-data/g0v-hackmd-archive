A car is nothing without an engine, and an engine is nothing without a cooling system. An automobile cooling system always proves to be one of the most important features on a vehicle.

How does a heat generating machine survive if there is no cooling available? A complex mechanism of the cooling system makes it possible. However, such a system consists of a number of parts and there is a probability of wear and tear of these parts.

Before moving further, let’s take a look at the cooling system and its functionality under the hood.
## What makes a cooling system so important?

Most important part of a cooling system is radiator as it dissipates heat from coolant. A pump circulates the coolant through the engine, hoses, and other parts of the system.

However, cooling system consists of fans to ensure sufficient airflow for radiator cooling, a thermostat valve to manage the temperature of the engine.

As an engine converts fuel into the kinetic energy, it usually releases the heat while making environment hot under the hood. However, cooling system has coolant to absorb heat when it circulates around the engine.

But, once coolant has finished its job, now it is time to radiator to do its job dissipating heat from coolant and blowing it out with the help of fans. However, Thermostat valve has an important role to play here too.

It proves to be useful in some condition when there is no need of cooling. Remember those cold mornings when engine needs some heat to warm up initially, at these times, thermostat closes to disconnect the radiator from engine so that it may get heated up enough.

The engine would always lose heat to the radiator and take longer to warm up without a thermostat. The thermostat modifies flow to the radiator once the engine reaches the desired operating temperature to keep the temperature steady.

The cooling system also includes elements of the ventilation system because engine heat is used to warm the interior of the car.

 As discussed above, these parts are essential for any automobile, but they also prone to wear and tear. Here, you get to learn about some parts of cooling system that might let you in trouble at some point of time.
## Radiator fails prematurely

Without a radiator, cooling system cannot work. However, it has the tendency to last for lifespan of vehicle. But, negligence might let you in trouble and encounter with a failed radiator.

Major reason of a radiator failure is introduction of aluminium wires with plastic headers. They are the replacement of more durable copper wire. However, former may bring some cost cutting, but they lacks in durability.

As you have been introduced with the importance of radiator, it is not something to take for granted as a mere negligence will end up costing you a fortune for a car engine repair. However, if you find something usual or temperature of your vehicle rise unexpectedly, just bring your vehicle at Service My Car at the earliest.
## Thermostat does not work properly

Thermostat works as a manager to a car’s cooling system. If it fails to manage the flow of coolant, adverse incidents can happen.

This tiny valve has a temperature-dependent open and close function. Your car may have trouble getting to the right operating temperature during the winter if the thermostat malfunctions while it is open. On the other hand, overheating can result from a thermostat that malfunctions when it is closed.

However, thermostat is not quite an expensive piece of cooling system component, but its failure might produce bad results.

Just head towards Service My Car, if you notice a check engine light on and your car’s engine does resist to the heat.
## Pump fails to circulate the coolant properly

As coolant or antifreeze needs a proper circulation around the engine, it could be water pump failure that might hamper the circulation and eventually engine ends up heated.

However, a water pump failure might happen anytime while it could be more drastic if occurs on a road. You have to ask for a roadside assistance or a car recovery to get your vehicle to a service station. Service My Car is available for your service anytime; however, you have to intimate.
## Hoses might worn out over time

Although radiator hoses are sturdy parts, they are susceptible to deterioration. Hoses frequently begin to break from the inside while still appearing intact from the outside. If the hose already appears swollen, it is unquestionably past its prime.
The replacement of the radiator hoses is a crucial part of maintaining the vehicle's cooling system. The last thing you want while driving is for a hose to suddenly burst. 

However, it is recommended to get the radiator hoses inspected once in six months at Service My Car.
 
 The abovementioned cooling components needs to be intact if you expect your vehicle providing you the luxury of riding. Besides, you also inspect the antifreeze level as it might reduce overtime or get degraded.
