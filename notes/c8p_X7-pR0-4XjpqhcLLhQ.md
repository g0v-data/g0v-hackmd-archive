PVC pressure fittings are specially designed fittings made from Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) material to be used in pressurized plumbing and piping systems. They are commonly used in applications such as irrigation, water supply, industrial piping, and pool systems, where they handle the flow of liquids under pressure. Here's a quick overview:

Couplings: Connect two pipes of the same diameter.
Elbows (90° and 45°): Change the direction of the piping system.
Tees: Create branch lines.
Reducers: Transition between pipes of different diameters.
Bushings: Reduce the size of a pipe opening.
Caps and Plugs: Seal the ends of pipes.
Unions: Provide a detachable connection for maintenance.
Adapters: Connect pipes to threaded connections or other materials.
Cross Fittings: Allow four-way connections.
