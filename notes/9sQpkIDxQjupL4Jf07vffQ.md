- How does vTaiwan ensure that the platforms are accessible and inclusive for all citizens? Ex; Rural communities, older people

3. Scope and Impact:
- How has vTaiwan influenced government policy or legislation? Can you give specific instances where public input through vTaiwan led to meaningful changes?

- Are there any issues or topics that vTaiwan avoids, and if so, why?
5. Community and Stakeholder Engagement:
- How does vTaiwan engage with the public and encourage active participation? What are the obstacles for a wider citizen-engagement ?
- How much the success of a process such as vTaiwan relies on the media campaign to promote it?

6. Lessons Learned and Future Directions:
- What are some key lessons that vTaiwan has learned from its experiences with digital democracy and open government?
- How do you see vTaiwan evolving in the future? Are there any plans for expansion or new initiatives? In case yes, are there any political or practical issues that are hindering its evolution?
