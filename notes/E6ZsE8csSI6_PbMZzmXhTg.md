## What if I can’t fully understand the responses to my request?

* **Contains facts** - A response may contain reliable, credible and accurate information, either partially or wholly.
* **Contains misinformation** - A response may contain false, inaccurate, or misleading information, either partially or wholly.
* **Contains personal perspective** - A response may contain personal perspective which makes it hard to tell whether it’s credible or not. We recommend you to consider different perspectives. They may fall into the following categories:
    * Personal perspective, life experience or value.
    * Failed to reach agreement.
    * Conspiracy theory.
    * Slippery slope.
    * Political speculation.
* **Invalid request** - The following situations may be considered invalid by the bot:
    * Chit-chatting with the bot.
    * The length of the message is too short to be recognized as a forwarded message.
    * The message is identified to be unrelated to hoax-busting.
    * The message contains a link only or the link is outdated.
    * You need to attach an image as reference but your linked image cannot be displayed. 
    * Commercial or promotional advertisement.


## I haven't received any reply yet.

After forwarding a hoax message to the bot, if it only shows “Read” by the message and you haven’t received any response from the bot, [please let us know by report to the group.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1847232902175197/)。

Due to a technical limitation, after submitting the request you will have to forward that message again to check if there’s any response.
The bot will not notify you whenever someone responds to your request post.
