# Walkthrough a Project 4.0
## Intro
Ecogenie is an IoT mobile app. It can help users (to) track household energy usage and monitor home connected devices suach as motion sensor, themperature sensor, smart meter and etc.. I led efforts to redesign the notification system and make motion sensor date more useful and accurate.

This project, I collaborated with 2 project managers, 4 dev teams and 1 UI/UX Design Intern. 

Before I diving into the process, I want to talk about why we initiated this project. Firstly, the notification system haven't been changed in 4 years since the 1st launch. Secondly, we were planning to enter the Japanese market and we are aiming to focus on female house mothers and male tech lovers, not just existing computer geeks. So we needed to simplify and polish the UI and make it more easier to use and reliable.

Usability Problems

How you discovered
1. Interviewing stakeholders
2. Competitor research
3. Concept testing
4. Audit the messages
```

> Final solution and some key features that will solve this problem as a whole.

```
Solutions
1. Used the timeline pattern on the notifications page to help poeple to see home activities at a gance. 
2. Added useful messages to improve the quality and reliability of our serivce.
3. Added options on the motion sensor settings and a thumbnail snapshot with a motion detected message to improve the quality and quantity of motion sensor notification messages.
