提案（自己的小松自己提案）

* 數位身分證議題：[共筆在這](https://g0v.hackmd.io/IJp-1Yz6SaaXJ4Q2DBOwPg)
*  Ai don't know new regulations here how you want to put the meeting result and discussion unto the FB as what you are doing now.
*  But to nite Ai proposed this and wish to discuss and start action so that shall be part of the meeting tonight .
*  However, the host that girl legal gov. girl left so the talk flow and the host is unknown so Ai was just waiting and waiting until now. You do the final report so Ai am wondering how we shall make this Small Song more effectively acting what we shall help the society . here in Dai2Won2 and other minority here who have mouth but no ability to voice for themselves and that's why Ai am here to be the spokeman to help those disadvantaged groups and minority groups who are helping Taiwan very much for all their life time.
*  Ai don't know if that's the right way to do it.To put on the FB or not, that 's the quetions. So Ai want to respect you and the Small Song for the operation and the Charter we 1st night organised ...however, tonight Ai don't feel the host or the selfgroupie is rooting in our original goal. Brainstorming , friendship catchup, then Social Actions make World Better seems missing part tonight.
*  Evern the Host or Leader or Note Small Bian shall be aware of the todo as what we always do in previous meeting SOP. Proposal, the initiated discussion and then open informaion let others who are interested in such topic or need such same help know there is A friend that they can call and come here to find SOS or at least their VOICE can be heard . No matter their nationality is TW or Dai2Won2 Passport holder or not

* Their work right and personal safety basic human rights can be protected.
* Offical International Victims Supporting the UN Supporting HoMe for financial difficulties and low income families.
* Proposal here at MiniSong so just asking for VProject 101
* what do you boys think? That's OK. Just for Yo Yuan Ren
* So just being polite. Not asking for any individual but for people who really need help and Ai think it's our young people's responsibility cos no disgusting adults helping them
* Sorry, pls can you email back to VC what Ai wrote cos it's my community service report to Cambridge Alumni Fellow 1,000,000 Scholarship Office, 3QQQ
