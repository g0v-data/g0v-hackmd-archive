# Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry
In today’s microservice-oriented applications, distributed tracking has become one of the most important components for monitoring and debugging purposes. As software systems become more intricate, organization and management of services are made possible. Open Telemetry, a common observability solution, makes it simple to implement distributed tracing by providing standardized APIs, SDKs, and exporters. In this article, users will learn about the basics of distributed tracking, how OpenTelemetry supports it, and how to do it in practice. The guide further includes necessary tools and challenges as well as best practices, thus giving a holistic view of the improvement of system observability using distributed tracing.

## Overview of OpenTelemetry
OpenTelemetry is a framework for observability offered as open source and allows the receiving, processing, and export of telemetry data, including traces, metrics, and logs. It has become possible through the merging of two previous projects, namely, OpenTracing and OpenCensus, which have complemented each other. The main task of OpenTelemetry is to help developers and operators. Deploying applications at all layers of the stack has made observability data collection more complicated because it is often done through specific vendors’ solutions.

OpenTelemetry consists of several key components. The API specifies how telemetry information, including traces and spans, is created and handled. The implementation of these APIs is provided in the SDK, which allows the creation and handling of telemetry in real applications. Another component of the architecture is the OpenTelemetry Collector, which is a stand-alone agent or service that collects telemetry data from applications, performs any necessary transformations and sends it to back-end storage for further processing. Exporters are ways to connect OpenTelemetry with different tracing and monitoring systems like Jaeger, Zipkin, or Grafana Tempo to ensure that the existing observability solutions work without change.

OpenTelemetry is inherently multilingual in that it can be used in frameworks such as Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, and the like, implying its use in several other systems. This multifunctional importance comes mainly in distributed applications where several technology stacks may be used to build different services. The framework also provides automatic instrumentation and manual instrumentation. With automatic instrumentation, it becomes easy because it simply allows the injection of span trace generation into some common libraries, while manual instrumentation enables users to develop their spans for more specific operations.

OpenTelemetry is an important aspect of contemporary observability as it standardizes the way telemetry data is gathered and allows for further use of already existing monitoring systems. OpenTelemetry minimizes the overhead associated with implementing distributed tracking and optimizes the ability of organizations to understand the performance and health of their applications.

## Distributed Tracing Concepts
Distributed tracing is the process in which a request is traced spatially and temporarily relative to other requests across several services within a system. The system then proceeds to decompose the journey into smaller units known as spans, with each spanning consisting of a single action bearing the least responsibility handled by a service. When these spans are joined, they create a trace, which illustrates the steps taken to complete the request within the system about the time taken in each step. In other words, it is important to have traces, spans, context propagation, and span relationships to cultivate distributed tracing.

A trace refers to the highest component that is concerned with the entire history of processing a specific request. In an online store, for instance, once the user initiates ordering a given product, this may involve several subprocesses, such as accepting payment, checking stocks, and perhaps updating other databases. This entire request, the one place, its back, and everything in between is referred to as a trace. Each service or component’s contribution to the flow of information in a request is called a span.

A span is an atomic part of a trace. In its most basic form, a span consists of the operation name, start and end timestamps, and attributes. For instance, in the payment processing service, one span may involve making a call to the payment gateway, and another span may involve validating the payment details. There could also be a parent-child relationship among spans, where a particular span is a high-level operation (for example, to place the order) and other lower levels are the operations geared towards achieving that higher-level span (for example, payment confirmation, inventory check). This hierarchy aids in understanding the interrelation among multiple operations and also their contribution to the overall request.

Within the realm of distributed tracing, context propagation is also of significant importance. For every service in the chain involved in serving a request, trace context—composed of the trace ID, the span ID, and any additional information that may be relevant to the execution of that request—should be passed. This makes it possible for the different services to associate their spans with the right trace, allowing for the recording of the entire lifecycle of the request. For example, in a scenario where the order service makes a call to the payment service, the order service needs to pass the tracing context using either HTTP headers or gRPC metadata. Otherwise, the separate spans of the request would remain individual, and it would not be possible to comprehend the progression of the request.

Elaborating on this with an example: suppose a customer uses an online travel agency to book a hotel. That request may go to the original front end first, and this would open a new span. The front end then has to reach out to the booking service to see if there are any rooms available, which also creates a new span before attention switches to call centers and back office systems, such as hotels and payments. Operations like these open up spans, and by ensuring trace context is passed through all services, the spans are woven together in a flow. This flow can then be presented on a Jaeger tool, for example, where developers can do things like see how much time was taken to carry out each operation and where a hold-up was if one of the outside APIs took too long to respond.

It is OpenTelemetry that allows these traces and spans to be captured effortlessly thanks to the instrumentation libraries that deal with context propagation for HTTP requests, queues, and gRPC calls. This means that regardless of the extreme distribution and asynchronicity, the full request path is visible, and developers can carry out performance monitoring and problem diagnosis.

## Setting Up Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry
The application of distributed tracing in OpenTelemetry comes in several stages, which include installing some libraries, instrumenting the code, and selling telemetry data to a backend system for analytics purposes. The whole process allows traces to be captured without any friction as they are passed along to various services. OpenTelemetry allows instrumentation to be done either automatically or manually so that the amount of control required can be maintained. In this part, we will go through the whole setup that wired tracing and give its examples for purposes of clarity and understanding.

### The Procedures

First things first, one needs to install the OpenTelemetry SDK or agent that is dedicated to the programming language in use. For instance, within a Java-based microservice, one can include OpenTelemetry dependencies either using Maven or Gradle. In Python, you will do pip install opentelemetry-sdk, and the resident SDK will be installed. The installation is a prerequisite core for tracing since it avails the required libraries that help in the generation and propagation of spans.

Now, the next step is to extend the functionality of the code you wrote in the previous step by creating spans and tracing requests. OpenTelemetry provides two types of instrumentation: automatic and manual. In automatic instrumentation, tracing code is embedded in popular libraries by OpenTelemetry, and this does not necessitate any changes to application code by developers. For example, if in Python one is using the requests library to make HTTP calls, an OpenTelemetry Python agent will create spans automatically for every outgoing HTTP request. This greatly simplifies the configuration hassle and guarantees that all relevant actions are traced.

Nevertheless, there are cases where manual instrumentation is necessary to collect data that is more detailed. In this case, the developer makes use of spans that they manually create to signify important milestones. As an illustration, within a Node.js service, it may be used in practice to create a span over a database query as follows:

```javascript
const { trace } = require('@opentelemetry/api');
const tracer = trace.getTracer('example-service');

async function getHotelInfo(hotelId) {
  const span = tracer.startSpan('getHotelInfo');
  try {
    const result = await database.query(`SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE id = ${hotelId}`);
    span.setAttribute('hotelId', hotelId);
    return result;
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
}
```

This time interval will also measure the duration for getting the hotel details with hotel ID as an additional attribute so that it will be easy to trace certain requests during debugging.

In this scenario, context propagation becomes important in tracking the flow of the trace context in between services. For instance, while making HTTP requests, the trace context is most of the time passed through headers. In a service based on Java, it is possible to propagate context in the following way:

```java
client.target(url)
      .request()
      .header("traceparent", context.getTraceParent())
      .get();
```
This guarantees that any service that processes the request at a downward level can connect its spans to the same trace.

After the completion of instrumentation, it becomes necessary to export traces to a backend system. OpenTelemetry allows the use of several exporters, for example, Jaeger, Zipkin, or Grafana Tempo, where traces can be viewed and explored. Exporters may be configured via environment variables or even programmatically within the application itself. Take, for example, the case of a Python application where an exporter may be configured as follows:

```python
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

exporter = JaegerExporter(
    agent_host_name='localhost',
    agent_port=6831,
)

provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(exporter))
```
This arrangement guarantees that the spans created by the service are forwarded to a locally deployed Jaeger service using port 6831 for easy visualization in Jaeger UI.
