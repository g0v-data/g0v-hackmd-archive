Understanding addiction triggers is a key step to sustainable recovery. Triggers are internal or external factors, as described at https://unitedrecoveryproject.com/rehab-blog/understanding-addiction-triggers/ , that trigger the desire to return to substance use or behavior. They can be emotional (stress, anxiety, depression), social (socializing with certain people, visiting certain places), or physical (specific smells, sounds). Successfully overcoming addiction involves not only detoxification, but also developing the skills to recognize and effectively manage triggers. This includes creating healthy habits, finding alternative ways to cope with emotions, and building a supportive environment. Thanks to this, a person can reduce the risk of relapse and achieve sustainable sobriety.
