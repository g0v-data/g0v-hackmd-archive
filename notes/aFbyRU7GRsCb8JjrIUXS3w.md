## Introduction
New Bloom is an English language magazine in Taiwan that was born out of the Sunflower Movement. They now frequently host events in both Mandarin and English.  Many of the contributors are familiar with coverage of g0v and Taiwan's civic hacker movement, however there have not been many opportunities for engagement across these communities. 

破土媒體是一個來自太陽花學運的英文雜誌。主要報道的內容是關於台灣跟其他亞太國家社運的發展。破土常常會舉辦一些講座。參與者有聽過 g0v，但是對於如何參與 g0v 以及 g0v 的開放合作模式不太了解。我們希望舉辦一個可以讓彼此溝通並且互相了解的活動空間。
