# Introducing g0v & FtO to (data) journalists in JP & KR

Dear friends, I am ==[name]==. Aside from my job as ==[job]==, I am also a g0v contributor and I would like to introduce [g0v](https://g0v.tw/en-US/) to you.

> If you already know what g0v is, come to Tainan, Taiwan for our next hackathon! For this hackathon we are inviting friends from Hongkong, Japan, and Korea to join us. You can sign up here: https://forms.gle/nhqJgWkuKqbaGwdx8

g0v is a Taiwanese community. We g0vers work to enhance sharing and collaboration among technologists, designers, activists, public servants, and many other professionals. We g0vers work together to create open-source projects for the public good.

Because of open-source, data and tools made with the community can be freely re-used and improved by anyone. Because of open collaboration, people from everywhere and every profession can help each other and work together. On the topic of data and journalism, many g0v projects are about open data, visualization, and interaction. I think if journalists, engineers, and designers could come together at g0v, we can make our data projects more relevant, while making news reporting stronger and more engaging.

On December 21, the g0v community is hosting its 38th hackathon in Tainan, Taiwan. About 150 people will gather and work on different projects on a variety of topics. This time, we are inviting friends from Hongkong, Japan, and Korea to join us for the entire weekend (December 20-22), to discuss problems and find solutions together as peoples of the ocean. I hope youâ€™re interested in joining this event. You can sign up here: https://forms.gle/nhqJgWkuKqbaGwdx8

Thank you for your time. Hope to see you in Tainan in December!
