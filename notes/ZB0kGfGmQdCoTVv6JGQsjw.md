<p>The complex mechanism of a car&rsquo;s transmission requires an adequate level of lubrication. However, the transmission fluid performs its duty properly until a leak allows it to flow out of the unit.</p>
<p>If there is talk about the automatic transmission, fluid is the lifeline of the system. However, any problem with fluid can offer you a bad experience.</p>
<p>The primary question at hand is what kinds of issues can arise with transmission fluid. Is there a serious risk of leakage? Is there a chance of contamination? Of course! It gathers dirt and grime. As it ages, it also begins to degrade. There are enough chances of the presence of sufficient metal debris too.</p>
<p>Therefore, your transmission is at risk because old, dirty transmission fluid doesn't flow properly. You should be aware of these signs that can update you about a degraded fluid.</p>
<h2>Transmission starts to produce grinding noises</h2>

<p>However, a dirty transmission fluid can make a noise similar to grinding noise, which is typically a sign of low transmission fluid levels.</p>
<p>If you hear these noises, check the fluid consistency and levels. Even if the fluid levels are sufficient, dirty fluid cannot properly lubricate the parts, leading to these strange and uncomfortable noises.</p>
<h2>Unusual gear shifting</h2>

<p>Since transmission fluid plays an important role in automatic transmission while managing hydraulic power, there could be some instances of gear slippage or incorrect gear shifting. It happens when transmission fluid does not perform its duty due to an impurity while having issues in managing hydraulic pressure.</p>
<p>However, it could be your transmission filter to blame. Fortunately, you always have the option to inspect your transmission at Service My Car and opt for transmission oil filter services if required.</p>
<h2>Abnormal occurrence of transmission whining</h2>

<p>Most transmissions with low fluid typically make a whining noise because low fluid puts a number of components under stress. Similarly, dirty fluids in a unit also cause a lot of problems. Correspondingly, if there is any strange noise, there may be a clogged filter and dirty fluid.</p>
<p>When your car whines while going backwards, there is a problem with the transmission fluid line. You should take care of this issue as soon as you notice it because if the line is clogged, the fluid cannot flow and your transmission is at risk of serious issues. If the transmission whines while moving forward, there may be a more serious issue with the torque converter.</p>

<p>No doubt, bad transmission fluid is not good news for your car&rsquo;s transmission. However, there is always a communication between the transmission unit and the engine. The engine receives intimation as soon as there is a problem with the transmission. Something inside your transmission may be in danger when the check engine light comes on.</p>
<p>In such a situation, it is best to get your vehicle to an expert at Service My Car as soon as possible. As the check engine light comes on due to a vast variety of issues in your vehicle.</p>
<h2>Extremely hot transmission</h2>

<p>A transmission requires the cooperative involvement of several metal parts. And there is always some sort of friction when they work together for a long time. The transmission fluid serves its purpose to keep your transmission at a safe operating temperature.</p>
<p>When there is any instance of contamination, the fluid's cooling capacity takes a toll, leading to an overheated transmission. An overheated transmission is a serious threat to a number of parts, like its cooling system for the engine. Sometimes, it can cause permanent and costly damage to your car.</p>
<p>You should visit a trusted workshop as soon as possible to avoid substantial damage that does not settle less than the complete gearbox overhaul.</p>
<h2>Sudden Jump in RPM just before shifting gears</h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*Hsi18z-EWs5Sd4qQr5R5Qw.webp" alt="" width="720" height="504" /></p>
<p>The fluid controls the hydraulic ability to shift gears, particularly in automatic transmissions. Your car's ability to shift takes a toll due to fluid contamination when its properties go bad. One indication of this is a longer time between gear changes, higher RPMs and an increase in engine noise is subtle sign of such an issue.</p>
<p>Usually, when the gear comes into an engagement, your car will lunge after the RPM increase.</p>
<h2>Why should you not neglect dirty transmission fluid?</h2>

<p>When you neglect this issue, contaminated transmission fluid can lead to expensive repairs as transmission parts start to deteriorate and need to be replaced. A transmission inspection and replacement are much less expensive than a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>Do not wait until your car is completely inoperable before consulting a professional. However, dirty transmission fluid is not good for a manual gearbox either, but it is a hazard for an automatic transmission, keeping its function in mind.</p>
