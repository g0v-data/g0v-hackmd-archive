### 視覺化方向


1\. 2D graph? 一軸Liberal/concervative / 一軸 china-leaning/ Taiwan-leaning

liberal/conservative 的軸可以用下面這個  或者是別的 study 做好的  就 take it as is

不曉得大家覺得怎樣?
我覺得  china-leaning/taiwan-leaning 這個軸比較容易測量的是
"Does the article think it's a good idea for Trump and Tsai to get on a phone"?
Explicitly bad, implicitly bad, neutral/unclear position, implicitly good, explicitly good

拉個時間軸  看看這些文章的風向變化  如果一個文章一個點的話  看從第幾象限跑到第幾象限

是
遍地開花的反川普反台灣 還是  隨便亂放

範例
