## Discussion topics

- Organisational form: Processes and practices for organising our workplaces ([Loomio](https://loomio.org), [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com)); Ethical business model
- Theory of change/vision, thinking behind horizontal and vertical. How do we make it adaptive/flexible. How to balance speed and participation.
- What's the situation in Korea?
- [Pol.is](https://pol.is/3bmres)

## 1\. Organisational form

We're designing Loomio to balance efficiency and inclusion, balancing idealism and pragmatism. Usually participation comes at the expense of speed, we want to break that tradeoff.

The Loomio organisation is "prefigurative": we organise ourselves in a way
We have a high degree of specialisation and mandate

Loomio: ([check our wiki](https://github.com/loomio/loomio-org) which explains some of the processes we use for our organisational structure)
- Board of Directors for e.g. compliance and oversight
- social enterprise
- worker-owned coop: people that work on Loomio own it and are the ultimate power
- coordinator, like a management role that rotates between members
- we run on Agile methodology: keeps us adaptive. Everyone can contribute to decisions that they are affected by or have expertise in, but they don't have to participate in everything

### Ethical business model


Principles:
1.  Money shouldn't be a barrier to people using Loomio
2.  We need to be financially self-sufficient

The current state of our business model: groups can choose to either pay a subscription or go on the gift plan. Subscription is a monthly fee for a group to use Loomio; Gift plan means we will ask your members for a donation.

Also we do consulting work in NZ and USA with e.g. government clients and large organisations. Training them in collaboration and participation and using Loomio. Next steps to try

Salaries: currently about 7-8 people working, will grow slightly next year.

### Contributions from the community

The software is open source [hosted on Github](https://github.com/loomio/loomio) \- anyone can go in and copy, modify, share, use the code. We've just developed a "[tech manual](https://github.com/loomio/tech-manual)" for people that want to contribute

We have an emphasis on user experience design. We want lots of people to contribute, but we don't want a big crazy messy platform that nobody understands. [Here's how we do design](https://medium.com/open-source-design/open-source-design-just-steal-everything-5c44ca793721)

### Stewarding: organisational wellbeing

We put a lot of energy into organisational wellbeing. Everyone has a steward, which is like a guardian. Someone to talk to, e.g. in a conflict. [Find out more here](https://github.com/loomio/loomio-org/blob/master/stewarding.md).

### Decision-making

We use Loomio to make decisions about Loomio. We have different circles of stakeholders, each with their own decision-making group.

E.g. the Board have meetings once per month, and they make decisions in the Board group on Loomio. The co-op members have another group. The Loomio Community is another, huge group.

If a decision affects you more, or you have more expertise, then you have more say in a decision.

## 2\. Theory of change/vision/culture

People are educated within a hierarchical form, they might have an idea that horizontal forms are superior, but have no experience of it.

Our whole political system is broken, how can we fix it? We looked at the challenge of large-scale democracy and felt daunted. We noticed that even small groups of people who want to collaborate well, have a hard time working in this way. So we decided to help them work well first, knowing that there are many hundreds of thousands of groups. In total they create a huge wave of change.

Activist movements spread so rapidly now with the instant transmission of information. E.g. methodologies

We talk about "innovation" and "collaboration", rather than "participatory democracy" or "distributed power", because all organisations want that. We talk about "decision making" rather than "voting".

If we can demonstrate that an open source social enterprise workers coop can be a viable way to run a business and deliver positive social return, then we can expect many organisations to copy us.

Often as political movements gain power, they lose their systemic focus, they make small change instead of the big change we need.

Paul Hawken's book [Blessed Unrest](http://www.blessedunrest.com/) is a map of mission-driven organisations pushing for systemic change (environmental, social justice, etc). Loomio is designed to empower groups like them to be more effective.

We can use tech to unburden governance systems from all the millions of little inefficiencies.

## 3\. South Korean context: challenges, opportunities for change

There's a generational problem. Younger and older people have very different sensibilities.

Korean's history is very condensed. Super poor in the 60s, now had massive economic development. E.g. the old generation never had a typewriter, but they skipped straight to smartphones.

The anti-communism movement of the past was focused on efficiency. e.g. we need great leadership, fast decisions. This is in conflict with the new generation.

New tools and new processes exist, but the feedback isn't effective yet. Younger people are being educated in the older institutions.

E.g. using Loomio in a Korean company: workers might not want to have an opinion different from the boss.

How fast and how big can we make a change? If the people of Korea can turn its economy around in 50 years, and suddenly become world leaders in technology, could they do the same again with organisational form? E.g. if we see massively successful companies in Silicon Valley that are operating in non-hierarchical forms, maybe that can be an argument for reducing hierarchy in Korean organisations.

Cultural background: it's common for people to keep their opinions to themselves, e.g. out of respect for your elders. The solution is to practice discourse, deliberation, not just speaking but also listening.

## 4\. Pol.is Platform

In future: business model will compete with Survey Monkey, doing sentiment analysis. Unique combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Pol.is is a new way for people to interact, so that basic experience needs to become familiar, before we can innovate further on the user experience.

It is designed to be embedded anywhere, shared on social media and embedded in e.g. news websites.

Finding that people are much more willing to vote than to comment.

In a political application: you can vote or comment on particular issues and find that you will find yourself moving closer to the position of a candidate.

Will people manipulate their own votes out of a desire to be near people they favour?

Data analysis problem to detect and reduce manipulation.

Pol.is and Loomio both display people's opinions along with their identities, which is different from traditional anonymous voting. The anonymous option suits a low-trust group. In the digital realm, that needs to be coupled with cryptography etc.
