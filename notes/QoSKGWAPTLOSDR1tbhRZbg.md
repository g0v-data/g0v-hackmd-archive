## Statement

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) targeted the fact-checking project for an audit under the pretext of a comprehensive audit of the Viewer Media Foundation, imposing a recovery amount and fines exceeding 750 million won on Parti. In the audit report, the KCC labeled Parti as an "organization misusing personnel expenses," claiming that "personnel costs were used for purposes other than intended," and released the audit results without reflecting the explanations from the audited organization.

Media outlets such as Chosun Ilbo, KBS, Yonhap News TV, SBS, Free Journal, and Digital Daily reported the KCC's press release without any additional investigation. During the reporting process, there was no effort to ensure the right of reply for the parties involved, such as FactCheckNet and Parti. As a result, the KCC's unilateral claims spread as if they were factual.

In particular, Chosun Ilbo distorted the contents of the KCC's press release and reported false information. Chosun Ilbo stated, "In the case of the development manager, Mr. Kim, his salary in December 2021 was 5.3 million won, but it was reported that he was actually paid 9.2 million won based on the average salary of IT planners," implying that a higher salary was paid than what was actually reported. Based on this, the headline of the report described it as "Personnel Costs Doubled," portraying it as a serious misconduct.

Chosun Ilbo's claims are clearly false. The KCC explicitly stated in the press release that "the actual monthly salary is 5.3 million won, yet the average salary of IT planners was applied to calculate the standard salary as 9.2 million won." This means that the KCC applied the average salary criteria for software engineers, not that an actual salary of 9.2 million won was paid. Nowhere in the KCC's press release does it state that 9.2 million won was paid.

I will ask Chosun Ilbo: What is the basis for claiming that Parti inflated personnel costs by double? Aside from reprinting the KCC's press release and distorting it, what investigation did you conduct to verify the claim of double inflation of personnel costs? Did you consider the potential stigma that expressions like "double inflation of personnel costs" could impose on the parties involved while writing the article?

Parti determined the personnel costs for the project based on the criteria presented by the KCC and the Viewer Media Foundation. Furthermore, all personnel costs calculated according to the criteria were fully paid to the people involved. The assumption that these funds were used for anything other than salary is false. After the project concluded, Parti submitted a financial report containing details of the personnel cost payments, and no issues were raised. Throughout the audit, Parti continuously clarified that "the determination of personnel costs was made according to the criteria, and all personnel costs were paid as actual salaries." However, the KCC ignored this. If Chosun Ilbo had investigated these details, would they have been able to mention terms like "double inflation of personnel costs"?

Recently, after it became known that the KCC imposed fines on Parti, criticisms such as "targeted audit" and "hasty administration" have emerged. The KCC's audit results and press release explicitly mention the "fact-checking project," and it was a well-known fact that this project involved FactCheckNet and others. If the media outlets, including Chosun Ilbo, that merely reprinted the KCC's press release had guaranteed the right of reply to Parti even once and attempted to investigate, such criticisms would have arisen much earlier.

Parti demands a correction from Chosun Ilbo and a right of reply report from the media that reprinted the KCC's press release without any investigation. In particular, Chosun Ilbo, which distorted the expression "double inflation of personnel costs" and misrepresented the term "calculation" in the audit results as "payment" without any investigation, must correct the report that stigmatizes Parti as an organization misusing personnel costs. If there is no correction, we will have no choice but to hold legal responsibility for damaging Parti's reputation under civil law.

## Press Release

Parti Requests Correction from Media, Including Chosun Ilbo, for Distorting the KCC's Announcement

    Media that unilaterally reprinted claims without investigation must ensure correction and right of reply.
    Chosun Ilbo reported clear falsehoods not found in the KCC's press release.

The social cooperative Parti (Director Kwon Ohyeon) has requested a right of reply report from media outlets that reported the KCC's fact-checking project audit results without investigation. They demanded that Chosun Ilbo, which reported false information not included in the KCC's press release, correct the distorted report, stating that if a correction is not made, they will have no choice but to hold legal responsibility.

The media outlets that Parti is requesting a right of reply from include Chosun Ilbo, KBS, Yonhap News TV, and SBS. These outlets reported the content of the KCC's press release, titled "KCC Announces Audit Results of the Fact-Checking Project," on January 18, 2024, without verifying the claims.

In the case of Chosun Ilbo, it reported that "in the case of the development manager, Mr. Kim, his salary in December 2021 was 5.3 million won, but it was reported that he was actually paid 9.2 million won based on the average salary of IT planners," implying that Parti inflated the salary. However, the KCC's press release only contained criticisms regarding the calculation of personnel costs and did not state that the amount was actually paid.

Parti explained in a statement that "throughout the audit, Parti continuously clarified that 'the determination of personnel costs was made according to the criteria, and all personnel costs were paid as actual salaries,' but the KCC ignored this," indicating that Parti's explanations were not reflected in the KCC's audit.

Furthermore, Parti pointed out that "Chosun Ilbo, KBS, Yonhap News TV, SBS, Free Journal, and Digital Daily reported the KCC's press release without any additional investigation," thereby failing to guarantee the right of reply for the parties involved, such as FactCheckNet and the social cooperative Parti.

Parti has communicated to the media that reported the information to ensure the right of reply. In particular, they demanded a correction from Chosun Ilbo, which reported information not found in the press release, asking, "What is the basis for claiming that Parti inflated personnel costs by double?" They warned that if no correction is made, they will pursue legal action.

Kwon Ohyeon, Director of the social cooperative Parti, stated, "The KCC conducted the audit unilaterally, and Parti's explanations were not reflected at all. Nevertheless, the KCC's audit results were conveyed to various media outlets. It is only right to guarantee proper rights of reply and correct distorted reports," urging the media to ensure the right of reply and issue corrections.

# ChatGPT's Deep Research for Parti's situation

## Overview
The South Korean civic tech group Parti (Îπ†Îù†) has actively promoted citizen-driven fact-checking initiatives. One of its leading projects was the FactCheckNet (Ìå©Ìä∏Ï≤¥ÌÅ¨ÎÑ∑), launched in 2020 as an open platform where citizens and professional media collaborated to verify misinformation.

However, after a change in government, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) accused the project of political bias and misuse of public funds. Under pressure from budget cuts and audits, the platform was shut down in early 2023. Parti is now continuing fact-checking activities on its own platform‚ÄîDigital Civic Square (ÎîîÏßÄÌÑ∏ÏãúÎØºÍ¥ëÏû•)‚Äîin preparation for the 2025 presidential election.

In parallel, KCC decided to impose heavy penalties on Parti, including an order to return subsidies and pay substantial fines. Parti has condemned these measures as "targeted oppression."

## FactCheckNet and Other Related Projects
### FactCheckNet (Ìå©Ìä∏Ï≤¥ÌÅ¨ÎÑ∑)
- Launched in November 2020 as a citizen-participatory fact-checking platform.

- Co-funded and operated by Parti, the Korean Journalists Association, the Broadcasting Reporters Federation, and the PD Association.

- Enabled citizens to propose questionable claims for journalists and experts to investigate together.

- Provided education programs, contests, and research support.

- Participating media included Newstapa, NewsTof, Yonhap News, KBS, MBC, YTN, MBN, and others.

- Served as a repository of verified content and developed tools like AI-based verification and deepfake detection.

### 2025 Presidential Election Fact-Check Project
After FactCheckNet's termination, Parti independently launched a new fact-checking project via its Digital Civic Square to engage citizens in checking suspicious political information spreading on YouTube and social media.

- Volunteers were recruited as ‚Äúcitizen fact-checkers.‚Äù

- Aimed to foster a culture of public verification outside of mainstream media.

- The project continues the philosophy of collaborative fact-checking from FactCheckNet‚Äôs legacy.

## Short History of FactCheckNet
### How it began
- Originally initiated under the Moon Jae-in administration, supported by government budget.

- Emphasized editorial neutrality and aimed to verify misinformation across political lines.

- Achieved recognition from KCC as an ‚Äúoutstanding project.‚Äù

### Political shift and shutdown
- After the conservative administration came to power in 2022, criticism grew:

    - The ruling party, People Power Party, called it a "left-leaning" initiative.

    - Claimed media involved were mostly progressive or public, excluding conservative voices.

    - Pushed through steep budget cuts:

        - ‚Ç©2.74 billion in 2021 ‚Üí ‚Ç©1.74 billion in 2022 ‚Üí ‚Ç©610 million in 2023.

- On January 25, 2023, the board decided to dissolve the foundation, officially ending the service on February 28, 2023.

- Despite the closure, groups like Newstapa and Parti declared they would continue citizen-based fact-checking independently.

### Audit, financial Issues, and penalties
#### KCC Audit Findings
A large-scale audit by KCC (late 2023 ‚Äì early 2024) alleged several issues:

- Misuse of funds: Overestimated salaries for IT engineers and unauthorized budget allocations.
- Improper vendor selection: Suggested that certain partner organizations (e.g., Parti) were pre-selected.
- Ownership dispute: App ownership was given to an external group, contrary to the original agreement.

KCC responded with:

- Severe warnings to the media foundation's director.
- Referral of responsible officials for disciplinary actions and criminal investigation.
- Demand for reimbursement and damages.

Critics labeled this a "targeted audit" influenced by political motivations, especially since multiple media organizations aligned with the previous administration were audited and had leaders removed.

### Penalties on Parti
- In February 2024, KCC ordered a refund of about ‚Ç©180 million.
- On April 16, 2024, they imposed a ‚Ç©566 million fine on Parti (3x the refund amount).
- Parti's total liability: ‚Ç©750 million (approx. $560,000 USD).

KCC defended this as legal enforcement based on the audit, but Parti:

- Argued the total aid they received was only ‚Ç©400 million.
- Claimed the fines were "excessive and politically motivated."
- Filed a lawsuit and injunction to halt enforcement.

KCC simultaneously announced a new fact-checking platform for 2024, replacing Parti‚Äôs model with a multi-vendor, more government-managed system.

## Public and Media Reactions in S.Korea
### Progressive Media & Civil Society
- Outlets like Hankyoreh, Media Today, and OhmyNews criticized the government:

    - Called the audit "a political attack" and "retaliation."
    - Suggested it undermined democracy and freedom of expression.
    - Civil society warned of a ‚Äúchilling effect‚Äù on public watchdog functions.

### Conservative Media
- Chosun Ilbo and Newspim echoed the KCC's stance:

    - Argued that FactCheckNet wasted taxpayer money.
    - Denounced the project as biased and lacking transparency.
    - Called for full investigation and overhaul of fact-checking systems.



### Parti's Response and Continued Advocacy
- In a joint 2023 statement, Parti and the foundation stressed:

    - Their independence and dedication to civic collaboration.
    - Fact-checking was a public good, not a political tool.

- Parti chair Kwon Oh-hyun (Í∂åÏò§ÌòÑ) called the penalties ‚Äúclear oppression.‚Äù
- Announced intent to fight through administrative litigation.
- Called for public support, asserting:

> ‚ÄúThe suppression of fact-checking culture is a regression of democracy.‚Äù

Several civic organizations issued formal letters urging KCC to rescind the penalties and reevaluate the project.

## What then?
The FactCheckNet issue reveals both the potential and fragility of civic tech in polarized societies. The request from Parti and aligned civic tech communities in South Korea are:

- Share the news across regional and international fact-checking community
- Publish a joint statement of support


Despite increasing polarization and political instability, the fact-checking space should be protected as a critical part of democratic infrastructure. This is an opportunity for regional and international actors to come together in solidarity, coordinate responses, and defend the integrity and resilience of our efforts across the region.
