## Content to prepare together before the session
### Self intro
- bil
- chihao

g0v = community (ies), movement, value(s)
g0v contributors, not representatives

### A short intro of g0v
- g0v Manifesto
    - https://g0v.tw/manifesto/en/
- (from g0v.tw website) g0v 是一個草根式的公民社群，致力於加深公民對社會的貢獻以及彼此間的連結。
    - g0v is a grassroots civic community dedicated to deepen civic contribution to the society and the connection with each other.
- 透過 g0v 社群，你可以在這裡尋找志同道合的夥伴，以草根的方式實踐你的理念，並將成果以開放授權模式釋出，讓更多的人可以站在你的成果上接力賽跑。
    - in g0v, you can find people that has similar interest and way of working, 
- 將 gov 以「零」替代成為 g0v，從零重新思考政府的角色，也代表數位原生世代從 0 與 1 世界的視野。
    - g0v substitute the o in gov with 0...
- Don’t ask why nobody is doing this. You are nobody
- "Nobody can do everything"

### Some (good? successful? failed?) examples of gov-g0v collaboration

before collaboration, there were confrontation = demos of alternative ways of public governance
- not only "this is bad" but "this is better"
- central gov budget visualization
- political contribution transparency

g0v hackathons are a great place for collaboration across all kinds of professions and disciplines

## More info about the participants
Seminar participants come from countries from all continents and have a diverse background in activism, journalism, government and business. All are somewwhat familiar with the basics and current topics discussed by online acvists. They have limited knowledge about Taiwan, probabyl none about G0V, but will have watched a video about Audrey Tangs work as minister for basic introduction of the session. 

## Seminar abstract
Liberals nerds from all over the world will discuss the hot topics of our times—ranging from the market powers of big tech and the problem of disinformation to the future of democracy in the age of big data. Because besides all tech optimism, there is also a dark side to the story: Digitalization has given rise to new and powerful threats to democratic processes, human rights, and the rule of law. And the solutions to such challenges are far from obvious from a liberal perspective. Hence, it is on us to strike a balance between recognizing the positive disruptions of an Internet age and the concerns for its impact on inclusive liberal democracies.
