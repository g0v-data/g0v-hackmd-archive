LinkedIn has grown into more than just a networking platform; itâ€™s now a space where businesses can actively generate high-quality leads. One of the main advantages is that you can target decision-makers directly, something not always possible with cold emailing. Of course, the competition is higher, and many people are already trying to pitch, which makes standing out more difficult. Creating insightful posts and engaging with industry discussions often delivers better results than direct spamming. A good example of this can be seen in https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7360705310233104385
, where consistent posting and value-driven engagement resulted in measurable growth. The key seems to be providing useful insights rather than pushing sales aggressively.
