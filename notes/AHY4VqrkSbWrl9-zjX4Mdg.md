Its goal is to demonstrate and support technological solutions that help stakeholders understand, expose, and counter problems of disinformation and propaganda. Co-hosted by the American Institute of Taiwan (AIT) and the Global Engagement Center (GEC), this Tech Challenge will focus primarily on Taiwan and other East Asia Pacific-based technologists.
