Over the years, g0v contributors have “opened up” Taiwan’s antiquated government bureaucracy. 

They join their frustration to tear things down, optimism to make things together, and openness to share things to make themselves both protesters and collaborators. 

As protesters, these hackers made governments listen by demonstrating what is possible. Their demonstrations led to the creation of data.gov.tw, join.gov.tw, vtaiwan.tw, and most recently the governmental political contribution open data portal. 

As collaborators, some served on various national and local government bureaus or policy committees. Some worked tirelessly to build trust with public servants, introduced tech tools into existing organizations, facilitated public policy communications, or hosted open data hackathons. When protesters and collaborators work together, they change things. Perhaps most importantly, they have planted the idea of change.
