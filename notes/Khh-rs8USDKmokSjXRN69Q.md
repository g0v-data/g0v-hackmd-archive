In essence, not changing your oil regularly is the same as drinking dirty water for a prolonged period. The oil has additives that break down after extended usage. It also loses its specific grade of viscosity.

The oil that moves through the engine motor picks up any unburned gasoline. Dirty oil can leave some of this dirt inside the engine and form mud. Engine oil is used for these crucial reasons - 

• It cools the engine down along with the engine coolant 

• It lubricates the motor

• It eliminates any suspended dirt which is filtered through an oil filter 

As a result, it's vital to change your engine oil periodically.

As the oil flows into the engine, a lot of particles start to gather internally. After prolonged usage, the oil combines with these particles and turns into a muddy sludge.

Car owners who live in drier, dustier areas tend to have considerably more particles in their car's engine console. It's best to change your engine oil and supplant your channels on a favorable premise.

Getting an oil change will ensure you remove all the dirt and hazardous waste from your engine before it can cause severe damage. 

**2. Routine oil changes ensure a longer life for your car's engine**

Think of oil as the backbone of your vehicle. It lubricates and ensures your engine's performance by protecting its essential components from wear and damage. 

However, the problem is that oil goes dirty. Getting an oil change guarantees that your engine stays in top condition, saving you time, money, and stress.

Many vital parts, such as the camshaft, make your engine run correctly. These poles control the cylinders in your engine rooms.

The camshaft helps to open and close the smoke valves on the vehicle. Periodically changing your engine oil is essential to keep these segments moving well and functioning legitimately.

As part of Service My Car, we suggest you take any emissions test and protect the environment.  Such tests typically revolve around the particles that are received as hydrocarbons and discharged into the air. 

If you neglect an oil change, all the grime and mud developed as hydrocarbons get expelled.  These are then consumed, causing more of them to get discharged in the air through the vehicle's fumes.
