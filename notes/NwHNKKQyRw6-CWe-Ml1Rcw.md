# da0 Design Concept Document
### Goal

Overview of design iterations with guidelines and principles. Adding g0v historical context, da0 forward thinking web3 ideas to help others gain knowledge and can help come up with different options for our early concept da0 logo we can further iterate on. 

### Context

- What is [g0v](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/manifesto/en/)?
    - Founded in Taiwan, "g0v" (gov-zero) is a decentralized civic tech community with information transparency, open results and open cooperation as its core values. g0v engages in public affairs by drawing from the grassroots power of the community
    - 10 year history

- What is da0? 
    - [tentative mission] A DAO structure with mission of “Build web3 infrastructure and tools to supercharge g0v projects under principles of civil, open-source, action driven to empower autonomous individuals.”

    - da0 is an infrastructure, tooling layer on top of g0v, not meant to to be a replacement, iteration or fork of it. Can consider it like a branch out of g0v, to try out web3 tools with the goal of merging back with other branches by providing them tools they will hopefully find useful.

    - 1) keeps the cross O reference that means “slashing the O” to Zero
    - 3) adds layering which represents web3’s composability
    - 5/6) the dots represent poly centric concept of g0v, a network of nodes rather than scattered individuals (a semi-decentralized, poly-centric concept)
    - 13) the pixels represent web3 culture, with the 3 dots also can mean web”3” and keeps the 1) reference
    - 19) combines all 3 to make one letter concept
    - Preferences from attendees
        - 13 & (1+3)
- Third iteration (need designer help)
    - Going deeper into the 13 & (1+3) designs

### Design principles

These were some things people felt are important to keep

- Make the reference to g0v obvious.
- Keep the slash across the 0

Optional ones people liked 

- Layers to represent composability
- Pixels to represent web3 og style

### How to help

- Feel free to add any exploration or concepts directly on this document!
- Message in #web3 or DM Noah, Mashbean, Jacky on slack if there are more questions or context needed!
