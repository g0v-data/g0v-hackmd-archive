Today is the 0th day of the summit 

In the beginning, we organized this FtO for foreign friends but becasue of covid 19, traveling is almost impossible, (so the online-live substitution for remote participants is available).

Last year in December we hosted a FtO in Tainan

Now we will do training for newcomers
FtO started last year, it is a collaboraiton between Japan, Taiwan and Korea

Korea: founded Code for Korea. Work a lot on COVID-19

Later HK contributors joined FtO community as well.

(there are around 20 ppl online)

Please wear your mask on if you are not eating

Online lobby: [jit.si](https://meet.jit.si/fto-tainan-2020-lobby)

Step 0: connecting to WiFi 
step 2: overcome the language barrier 
1. [online collaborative note](tinyurl.com/ftofto
)
2. [online text translation](g0v.hackmd.io/s/rJ9wtnrsD) (this doc)

https://tinyurl.com/FtOFtO
The book has all the information from this hackathon and from previous FtO hackathons. You can find all the proposals here, if you have any plan. feel free to fill it. 

Propose now! https://tinyurl.com/FtOFtO

Please add your 3 keywords on the info sheet, a g0v tradition to introduce yourself.

If you are new to FtO, how to make friends?
In g0v hackathons, we have stickers at g0v events that represent different skills,

(log:fighter jet passing though our head, there is an airbase nearby)

Today we don't have stickers. 

Please mingle with other people
Please ask questions

Be polite and it will be okay

(introducing 1 sentence about yourself)

This is the code of conduct for all g0v events
https://summit.g0v.tw/2020/en/code-of-conduct


If you don't know what to do, start from documenting or (real-time) translation is a good way to start.

Anyone don't know how to use HackMD?

Here are the different communities that are connected by FtO: g0v, Code for Japan, g0vhk.io, Code for Korea, nullfull

So sad that we can't go to those places.

PLease join g0v SLack. https://join.g0v.tw

Please eat as much as you can 
As how much you eat will be how far your project is going

We try to make everything we do here open source: open source open mind open collaboration.

Thank you to Tainan City Gov, Open Culture Foundation and Today's host A-Break-Cafe 


Everyone is "nobody"

Happy hacking!

So let's start with the proposals

Often when we talk about a politician, we only know their basic info, such as gender, age, education etc. But what is actually most important are there personal connections. So what we want to do now is make a database which collects and connects informaiton on the links between politicians, businesses, and organisations. What we've done so far is the links between people, but most of our database is empty. We want more information on the people, such as their public speeches, publications, contributions. 

    ``
(social network or relations of Taiwanese politicians, especially what kind money they took (and how much), publications...etc.)


What we already launched technical part:
- keystone.js (MIT license)
- vue.js
- React.js


All crowdsourcing contribution contents will be released in cc0.

What helps we need (see slide pp.8):
1.  Political Donations
2.  Their publications, including academic.
3.  speeches
4.  their assets, eg. real estates, vehicles...etc.
5.  and more you know or want...

At the moment, we only have people and business data, but what we need is more information on speches, etc
so we need people to help out 


We still don't have a page that shows all our data at the moment.

We need internationlization (i18n) help.

I haven't finished the slides.

This year because of pandemic, we are quite chill.
Some foreign friends wrote to us after visiting our website for more information. 


Our current website looks like this: it is quite empty >>> open https://fto.asia

You will enter HackMD collaborative notes. That's it!

So we are trying to think about how to make the website better/what framework we should use 

Welcome anyone who is passionated about FtO, who is interested in designing the information structure of the website

This part is about tree planning.

Evaluating the opportunity or potential place where Taiwan could plant more trees.  This is an GIS project... 

GIS project

I will 1) introduce several tools we developed, 2) next year international GIS collaboration

(airplane again) (recommended: fighter jet)


Basically it is all about policy

statelite data to find where is the grass and trees

we calculate the opportunities to plant more trees in Taiwan. Our calculation is 

2.7 million trees may be ideal numbers to plant based on our analysis.


Yesterday when I came to Tainan, I walked around the coffee shop to see the potential sites, including the park. 

This is another tool to help users find spaces. So you can look for different types of potential sites. We need a website to help the users to find their targets. 


And this is a nother tool called "Unlimited Cities DIY", which helps the users to imagine their ideal environment. So there is a tool to place a virtual tree onto the environment.


Another tool is called "treepedia" it is based on google streetview and uses it to calculate the "green view", which helps us to analysis situation about linear spaces.

We use airtable to collect data, setup knowledge management framework.


And finally, we have to collaborate with the government, including we participate in the presidential hackathon and propose this idea to the government. And then they also set out a policy, and on the slide you can see, several sectors commited to do some policy about green covering. And then we visited several local governments. 

I want to introduce IGC framework, which is an international event for countries to discuss where to plant trillion trees.

In a good case we can find vacant land. This land is more suitable to discussion of treeplantiing in the next steps. 

So we need to combine this type of zoning data and zoning policy to include to zoning policy in this type of work. 


If you want to learn more about this measure you can just key in IGC 2021. Maybe in your country there is also an organisation hosting this kind of project.

Hello today I want to talk 0 archive. 

We want to track disinformation and content farm.

We have been collecting online contents of Taiwan, e.g. media websites, online forums, content farms.

Up to today, we have already collected 4 million publications. 

This is a graph of the publications we have collecited. The X-axis is time and the Y axis are the number of articles 

The data can be used to analyze where the edisinformation comes from.  It is the largest traditional Mandarin content database.


This is the largest open source traditional chinese database.


Our parsers use readability at the moment, but this doesn't work on certain websites. So we want to try to write the parser for each site.

What we need >> see the [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lGt2F3qaCV5Z8eeYsnIXeeZf0yZO0x2aAvbg8T2A1Zw/edit#slide=id.gaef8cd5205_1_22) page 8

This is a project that is in the early stages. And it is quite different from the other projects in the political point of view.


Discussing boundaries has always been hard to define properly, they are usually vague (or opaque) and usually unilaterally judged by our cognition or context.


The first thing we want to discuss is violence, which has many different aspects. Including, physical, gender, mental. Violence doesn't just have to be physical. 


The core of violence is that we break others' boundaries.

This type of violence is all around us. Violence is not just the kind of stuff you see on the news.



Mostly, I want to talk about body and sex violence


For example

Let's talk about a man and a women, and then man starts touching the women's body, and the women isn't sure if she wants it but the man keeps touching her body. They didn't make love to the last step, I meant, physical intercourse and penis insertion.

The next day, the women feels uncomfortable that she is raped while the man feels he already had consent.

A lot of cases are in grey areas.

Violence is when borders are crossed. This has two steps, first, you notice where your borders are. 



What are boundaries? There are a lot of borders in our daily life. For example, at this hackathon, I know I can't randomly go kiss a g0v volunteer. (however you might be offended I called your name in somehow inappropriate way.) Even though we didn't discuss this beforehand. ?


but the difficulty is we are not used to having this discussions, 

for example, how closed I can get to you


Execise from the book: [The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Freedoms in Sex and Love（3rd Edition）](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Slut-Practical-Relationships-Adventures/dp/1587613379)《道德浪女：多重關係、開放關係與其他冒險的實用指南（第三版）》

YES/No/Maybe
List all intimate/physical interactions you can think of and your answers in different circumstances

eg. will you accept sharing a toothbrush if we live together?


When your boundary is crossed. Often we don't know what our boundaries are, but when our boundaries are crossed, we often feel very uncomfortable. So what should we do?

Say no is not easy. 

It is especially hard but not exclusive to Taiwan. Taiwanese culture values harmony a lot, and avoid many negative emotions such as embarassing.
(if you are interested in how psychologists define "harmony", please see: 黃囇莉。（2016）。人際和諧與衝突：本土化的理論與研究。台北：揚智。)

For example, if you're eating dinner with some people, when you feel something is not fit your appetite, would you not directly say to the others "oh this dish is really bad", it is very embarassing and usually not acceptable, instead you would still thank to the hosts but feel angrily (or something) privately.

My friend's French boyfriend directly said the food is not good while a stranger kindly took them for a meal.

Unclear boundaries
We barely negotiate boundaries
WE don't have chances/practices to say no

How can we assist people? 
Developing some tools

Brainstorming a toolkit
e.g. using scenarios to start discussion how to negotiate

when you are violented (sexually), you usually are too shocked to do anything, at least from my personal experience.

May we have a cheat sheet or a card that we can show to others to show our attitudes and want to negotiate following what rules?

Do I still have time to share a short story?

chihao: you already passed the time. THere are short talks in the afternoon.

So if you are interested in what I have just been talking about, regarding borders, boundaries, violence, consent, please collaborate with us on this project

Do you have LibreOffice on your laptop?

(resolving technical problems)

(presentation language: Mandarin)


I am a masters student at National Chengchi Univeristy, this is part of my proceeding thesis :

(this is the author speaking, sorry for my rude English speaking, but you can see translated introduction below:

Since the aftermath of Cambridge Analytica Scandal, advocacy on regulating social media using digital footprints for deploying targeted-ads on propaganda and commercial purpose has emerged. Despite academic literature discussing on data protection policy already exists, they mostly focus on law's perspective and administrative perspective was largely ignored (just based on my experience reviewing literature registered on SSCI). Even though being controversial, like the fearing of governmental surveillance, some government-led regulatory program may inevitable and even necessary. My plan of this discussion will mainly focus on governmental role on regulatory program, and policy tool may be deployed, and of course their pros and cons.)


In this hackathon, I would like to discuss the following topics (on slide) 

1. Does government need to regulate it?
2. How to regulate?
3. Pros and cons


Here are some recommended readings on this subject:

* link to slides: 
* link to chat: 

This is my first time in FtO.

I am from Hong Kong, has everyone heard that recently 12 Hong Kongers have been arrested to China? The accusion is that they wanted to smuggle to Taiwan.

They have been detained over 100 days in Shenzhen.
That can't access to their family and their lawyers.

This type of situation is actually quite common. Taiwan has Lee Ming-Che, a Taiwanes who has been jailed because of political reasons.

But I am not sure what we can do about it. But att the least we have to continue to follow these issues to make sure these events don't dissapear too quickly

==<< Now hacking time / lunch time ==

### short talks

(Now it is short talks)

Lulu (English): There are five short talks coming
But before the short talks, there is a very important task, and that is group photo! 
The first short talk is from Irvin. He is going to talk about Internet Health Report, and share the good and bad stories of the internet from each country 
(Mandarin)This year the report is using a slightly different form, and will discuss the situation in many different countries


Irvin: This is a project from Mozilla Foundaiton to connect internet issues from around the world. The report will be posted in January next year (probably) and will include stoires, statistics and other documents about the internet this year. Ths year, we have a very important part of the report, called the people's report, where we ask 100 people to discuss the internet in their country. We have asked Lulu from Taiwan to share one good thing and one bad thing from Taiwan. We have people from many different countries sharing their stories. If anyone is interested in sharing their stories come find me and we have a survey you can fill in. It has three questions: share a good story, a bad story and what do you think of the internet this year. You don't have to write a story, you can share a link from a blog or website. So that's all 

Come find me if you are interested in joining in. Any stories are OK, but it needs to be one positive and one negative. For example: digital ID in Taiwan, is this positive or negative? It's relative and it depends on your local area. So if you wanto share with the rest of the world, yeah

Lulu: Thanks Irvin for his talk. This internet health report is very important globablly. And not many people from East Asia have replied.
The next talk is from Jane and Tom to talk about the Thailand protests.

Jane: I will be the most lotech person here, I'm still using a notebook 

Chihao: This is live on the internet

Jane: We will try to be mor ecareful, there are certian issues that can not be discussed.

Hi everyone, it is also difficult to talk after lunch. 
So we're from Thailand and right now as you can see there are protests in Thailand and this is the 6th month of the protest. But the pro democracy movement in Thailand has deeper roots than that. And what we want to talk about is the challemges that the movement is facing. Thailand has an authoritarian government and it is cracking down on protests. One of the tools they use is disinformation campaigns. (Break)
The whole approach to crack down on protestors is old, it started in the 1970s (Break) (Airplane/fighter passed by.)

With this old approach, the government has relied on the same approach since the old times, with the model that the enemy is trying to overthrow the government and they think that any opposition is trying to turn Thailand into a repiublic. The monarchy is a sacred institution.

ISOP is a part of the military, they are trained as cybertoops, and they are payed. Since we have national conscription. Each year, men of 21 have to go through conscription. So that means you have roughly 1 million conscripts working as cyber trolls. 
On top of that the government also hire private companies who use bots to make certan hashtags trend. they have a manual on how to disseminate the messages. These messages 

(break) Line is the most difficult. The older generation tends not to fact-check the information they receive on Line. 
What I have seen is, activists are seen as republicans, and also, activists are framed as being linked to international movements. There are these crazy plots linking activists to HK, other countries, and even to Netflix. 

So what we want to ask is, how do deal with this, how do we identitfy bots

Tom: Most of the time I use facebook because I'm not part of the new generation. The new generation use twitter and they are much more aware of what is a fake account. But it is difficult for older generation to use Twitter. For those over 25, they tend to use Facebook, and the government sends a lot of troops onto this platform and try to discredit those who support the protests. My friends and I try to identify which ones are the fake accounts. So for example, if they have no picture or only one picture, and they only have four or five friends, and they only post political content, this is probably a fake account. So we don't want to reason with them (fake accounts), we just try to troll them back. Because we know the living conditions in the military bases. They are meant to recieve 200 (Thai currency ?) but because of corruption they only receive like 100, so we just ask them "are you ok, how is your life"

Jane: I think this is effective because we are not trying to attack them, but rather fraternise with them and say, hey I know you are also exploited labour. 



Lulu: Thank you Jane and Tom. I think many here might have a similair experience. 
The last talker is Depub He will share about decentralisation and blckchain

Depub: I am very happy to have this oppurtunity to share with everybody, and it is very meaningful that I can .......

--
3rd Short talk, by Ckxpress about Decentralized content registry to blockchain.

Take an example, in game of the thrones, if there are several Brandon (3-eyes crow) to save the human history, it is no way to wipe all data by just kill one Brandon. 

Iscn.io is like the blockchain version of ISPN. 

Here is my draft: 
When we say decentralised content registry, it might be hard to get. But if you are a fan of GoT, iit’s like, we’re trying to decnetralise Bran Stark, so we’re trying to make millions of Bran Stark. So we want to achieve three things. Actually, I listened to talk by 0 archve this morning, and I think there are a lot of similar points, they are trying to do it through an archive. 

If we had 0 archive in HK, it would be shut down immediately. There are three things we need to achieve in this project. The first is immutable content metadata. If I have  a photo, the photographer, the location, the data, and the copyright is metadata, and we want it to me immutable, so it can’t be erased without permission. 

Peer-to-peer through IPFS, which will allow us to achieve proven content integrity 

I don’t know if you know this image, it was taken last year. A bunch dressed in white (protestoors dressed in black) to help the police attack the protestors. This picture was taken by 
So if we have this system in place, for civic journalists, we will be able to distribute it more effectively, and we can mathematically prove that not a single pixel will be changed. 

In HK we are facing a very difficult time recently 
Yesterday, Jimmy Lai was in custody and he wll be in custody until April 

Related to this, the HK history museum was closed, it is closed for 2 years and we can imagine what it will look like when it reopens in 2 yeaes. So we havw this project to map the facts before its closed down .

So we have this project called ISCN.io. It’s like a branched version of ISPN? So that every image has a unique reference number 

So I came to Taiwan and I hope I can have everyon’s support 


lulu: the next event will be at 5 o’clock so if you have any progress you are welcome to share with us at 5pm

* link to Demo:https://g0v.hackmd.io/y8qY80IUTWeQGoC2IjvdXQ?view

I didn't open any document this morning. However, after I created the online pad for FtO Asia website, I saw Hal from Japan added so many thing (the webite development plan) in tht edocument. 
According to the development plan from Hal, I create a airtable, than someone was adding thing automaticlly into the table. 
People from the FtO groups start to enter data into the table, hence, I have (can) start to build the website now.

* link to Demo:https://jamboard.google.com/d/15ocGTQrFNTSc1Atq2qRUXLHE_3VGGCOXCJpuWw5xxFs/viewer?f=0

I created this board. We were chatting earlier, I was sitting on the side, taking notes. We talked about datasets and what datasets Taiwan currently offers. We talked abotu problems. And the biggest problem in Thailand is how to identify fake accounts. So we talked about identification, and that requires datasets. We talked about how we had taken action. We talked about how we talk to our family members and how we talk to fake accounts. I think this is a very important issue. Jane do you want to say something
Jane: No

Today we made some progress. We run 200 more sentences into the corpus. Which is about 0.1% progress. We have 15,0000 in total, and now we have three more pronounciations into the database. It will get harder, as the more common words will already be in the database, so I need help from people who are collaborating.

**Herstory in East Asia by ael**
* Demo link https://g0v.hackmd.io/EYSWYz8ZRB2oN6RHrVNf5g?both#Meeting-notes-of-2020123


The project is Herstory in Asia, which was first initiatied in the first hackathon last year. I thought it would be a fun project, but it has been 18 months already. A lot of g0v projects die, but a lot of Japanese and Korean people have asked me "hey how's it going", and at first I thought it was just a hackathon project that would die. But we have tried to keep it going. We have had monthly calls, we have developpers in Japan, Korea, and Tawian. The original thinking was we wanted to share the gender movement in our countries, and then we translate the stories into Korean, Japanese, Mandarin and English. that means we need to find people to write and people who are familiair with the women's movement. But it turned out not good. A lot of the people who are passionate about the project are not fluent in English, so there is a bit og a language barrier. And the Korea team Japan team and Taiwan team all want different things. So today we had a meeting and discussed a lot about what we want to do. We want to make it so Korean and Japanese don't have to come to Taiwan slack. I didn't know they have their own slack channels, so they speak to me in English on our slack, but speak in Korean and Japanese in their own slacks. In two weeks we have a meeting with a feminist groups and I am really excited about that. (gap)

Our participants should feel comfortable to particpate in the language in their own language so we need to work onthat. At least we can use google translate to translate the article between different languaes. I'm really greatful that the participants in Japan Korea Taiwan continue to support the project and have strong ideas. And we know it is not easy. 

Today was started to realise the different working styles of Korea Japan Taiwan. In Korea, they have a plan, and they have a checklist of what they want to do this week. In Taiwan, as far as I know, we don't have that. So it seems the style, and communication culture is different. So we are trying to overcome these boundaries, and we are doing that at FtO. Thank you to the organisers for organising this. And I kind of forgot there are Koreans and Japanese online.

(Myley) Thank you, and we can continue to collaborate, and maybe we can try to work out something better. 

(Mee) Fighting! 

Ael: Thank you everyone

I am surprised people wanted to talk about the project, because at first I thought I was wrong to join the hackathon, because this is so lowtech. This morning we talked about a lot of interesting things, such as how to raise awareness, 

We checked the material, and there is this real weird video for elementary school kids. And we realised, as kids, in the education system, they always teach you these really extremely cases. In reali life, we moslty face kind of grey areas. These kind of grey areas that we want to talk about in our projects. SO we want to think about what kind of material we can make. 

So we want to make "grey awkward cards" and you can share them with other people and discuss with others how would you react.

We also talked about the word "no", because it is different between Mandarin and English It is much more simple in English. How would you say no in Mandarin, would you say 不 or 不要？ probably not.

We also talked about practising. Like you go to martial arts classes to learn to fight, but can you actually fight someone? No, because it's all training. 

So we want to help people practise saying no and find out diffent
