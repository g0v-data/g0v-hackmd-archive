# Top Rust Front-end Frameworks in 2024
With optimal performance and safety aims, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is increasingly utilized in website creation, including the front end. The landscape is mainly occupied by [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) frameworks such as [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Angular](https://angular.dev/); however, contrary to their dominance, there are also various Rust-based front-end frameworks. The high performance levels they boast of, together with their strong typing capacities and memory safety guarantees make them an excellent choice for constructing contemporary web apps.

In 2024, various Rust front-end frameworks have distinct features and capabilities. The article highlights several Rust front-end frameworks specifically [Yew](https://yew.rs/), [Seed](https://seedframework.com/), [Percy](https://chinedufn.github.io/percy/), [Sauron](https://docs.rs/sauron), and [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/). Developers need to select among these tools as per their requirements thus the article provides an elaborate comparison of these frameworks including their strengths weaknesses and use cases. Furthermore, we will address how front-end developers can incorporate this framework with existing tools and enhance performance in web applications.

## Yew
Yew is an incredibly versatile tool that allows web developers to craft their front-end projects on the web using Rust and WASM. By way of compiling rust into WASM, it enables there design of excellent speed web apps resembling desktop applications when it comes to episode processing rates. Such an approach takes advantage of the following features inherent to Rust: a strong type system, a focus on safety, and concurrent programming. One of the most prominent things about Yew is that it’s component-based architecture; just as in some other frameworks like React. With this kind of approach, developers can build components that are reusable and encapsulated within themselves, meaning they take care of their state on their own and also respond to user events. Furthermore, Yew utilizes a declarative syntax for specifying user interfaces which is natural and similar to HTML making it possible for Rust developers to link their code directly with what will be displayed on screen.

There are a few things that make Yew a winning proposition. First, the language relies on Rust’s strict type system to catch a number of mistakes in advance of program execution. This leads to highly reliable and robust applications. Second, it uses Rust’s async/await feature along with multi-threading to be able to retrieve and handle data in a better way. Also, Yew allows seamless interoperability with JavaScript. This implies that developers can invoke JavaScript functions and merge the current JavaScript libraries into their Rust codes enabling a broad array of web technologies that accompany Rust. Selecting Yew is very exciting to those who know Rust already and want to manage their abilities in front end development. Besides being a good choice for projects requiring high-speed performance and dependability; because it employs WebAssembly, its execution is fast while at the same time ensuring an error-free application behavior.

### Setting Up the Environment for a Yew Project
To begin using Yew for front-end development, it is important to set up your development environment. This process entails installing the necessary tools and dependencies that are needed for Yew applications to be built and run.

First and foremost, make sure that Rust is installed on your machine. Rust is a systems programming language characterized by its high-performance levels and safe nature, which makes it indispensable while compiling Yew apps for WebAssembly. The installation of Rust can be done in several ways:

* Launch a terminal and execute the installation command for Rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
This command will download and install Rust including the `cargo` package manager that is used to manage Rust projects and their dependencies.

* After installation, ensure that Rust and `cargo` are available in your terminal by checking their versions:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```
* The next action you have at hand is to install wasm-pack, which is a tool designed to assist in the building of Rust-generated WebAssembly packages. It streamlines the compilation of Rust program files into WebAssembly modules and makes them ready for use with websites and applications developed in Internet-based platforms. By executing this command, you can get wasm-pack installed:
```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
```
In addition, you will need `trunk` - which is a build tool for various Rust projects that takes care of building and bundling Yew applications. Besides, Trunk serves your application locally for development purposes. To install trunk, use this command:
```bash
cargo install trunk
```
If you have installed Rust, `wasm-pack`, and `trunk` now it’s the right time to begin creating your new Yew project. In this case, this includes making a new Rust package, including Yew as one of its dependencies and setting it up for WebAssembly.

### Creating a New Yew Project
The setup of your environment for development marks the beginning of starting a new Yew project. In doing so, you will create a new Rust project, including Yew as a dependency, and setting up your project for WebAssembly compatibility. The following detailed instructions will help you begin:

* 1. Create a New Rust Project: To get things underway, you’ll want to create a fresh Rust project utilizing Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build system. Open the terminal at hand and type out this command:

```bash
cargo new yew_example --bin
```
It creates a new folder called `yew_example`. In this folder, there is the basic structure for a Rust project. This happens because you provided a command line option named --bin which tells it we want to create an executable rather than a library.

Enter into your project directory by typing:
```bash
cd yew_example
```

* Add Yew Dependencies: After that, you will have to insert Yew and other dependencies related to it in your project. Locate Cargo.toml in the main directory of your project. This file is where you mention all the dependencies for your Rust project.
To include Yew and its related libraries, type these lines below the section labeled ‘[dependencies]’:

```rust
[dependencies]
yew = "0.20" # Replace with the latest version if necessary
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"
```
`yew` is the Yew framework proper. `wasm-bindgen` is the library facilitating communication between Rust and JavaScript. `wasm-bindgen-futures` is a support for asynchronous operations in WebAssembly.

* Configure the Project for WebAssembly: It is important to adjust the `Cargo.toml` file by specifying crate type as `cdylib` to generate WebAssembly modules for your project.

You should add this configuration in `Cargo.toml`:
```rust
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[package]
name = "yew_example"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name"]
edition = "2018"
```
In the `[lib]` section, a dynamic library `(cdylib)` that can be utilized with WebAssembly is stipulated as an output. The `[package]` section contains your project’s metadata.

* Write Yew Code: Let’s start off by creating a simple Yew component for testing purposes. Erase the contents of src/main.rs and put in these words:
```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

#[function_component(App)]
fn app() -> Html {
    html! {
        <div>
            <h1>{ "Hello, Yew!" }</h1>
            <p>{ "Welcome to your first Yew app." }</p>
        </div>
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<App>();
}
```

This code provides a simple Yew component named App which displays a simple message: "Hello, Yew!". The `main` function initializes the Yew application and attaches the App component to the `DOM`.
