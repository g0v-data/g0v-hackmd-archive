Hi! American here. What can I do to help?

I worked as the writer on the [Birds Aren't Real](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/technology/birds-arent-real-gen-z-misinformation.html) project. 

I know a whole lot about memetic engineering, memetic praxis, participation structures, and how to combat disinformation online. I am interested in your organization. What can I do to help?
