> Student DAO Co-founders

As an important part of campus culture, student self-governing organizations keep the important tasks of enhancing student interaction, representing student rights, and the leadership of students. However, traditional working style of student self-governing organizations are facing numerous challenges. Decreased student participation, internal resource shortages within the self-governing organizations, and low information transmission efficiency have had a serious issue on the functioning of student self-governing organizations. These issues hinder the healthy development of student autonomy and prevent many students from fully experiencing and participating in the practice of student self-governance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new organizational model to address these issues and further advance the development of student autonomy. 

## Current Issues of Student Associations

The issues that we consider are urgent to solve in most of the student associations are listed as follows: 

### Decreased Willingness of Participation

Taking National Taiwan University (NTU) as an example, the voting rate of NTU Student Association's President has decreased from 53% in 1988 to 5.61% in 2023. Although the documents and regulations continued to complete, students' attention to the self-governing organization keep decreasing. A discussion of abandoning student association was raised in the NTU student Facebook group.

### Internal Resource Shortages and Poor Communication

Most student associations' office are shared with school clubs, that student self-governing organizations don't have their own meeting room, but have to share with club classrooms. Besides, the efficiency of internal and external communication doesn't seem to be high enough. Most used collaborating tools include Facebook groups and Google Documents, which regularly makes it hard to keep students in the loop. 

### Low Collaboration Between Different Student Associations

For most of the student associations, a representative will be voted as the main leader of discussion (association president), and set different task forces according to different tasks and works, which also have the lead of communication and managing. Aside from internal meeting, they will also attend different meetings as the representative of all students. However, the participants of student association who aren't in charge of the management and discussion aren't familiar with the main idea, goals and purposes of the organization, not to mention about external communication. 

### Lack of Inheritance in Main Idea during Transition

As that the majority of crucial information are mostly available for specific individuals, the loss of concepts during transitions regularly happen.
