**INVITATION ARS ELECTRONICA GALA 2018**

Presentation of the Golden Nicas to the 2018 Prix Ars Electronica Prizewinners
Awarding of the 2018 STARTS Prizes
Since its inception in 1987, the Prix Ars Electronica has been the world’s foremost competition in digital art—a showcase of excellence in CyberArts at the interface of art, technology and society. This year, renowned artists and up-and-coming young talents from 85 countries submitted 3,046 works for prize consideration by juries composed of leading international experts.

Once again this year, the European Commission is bestowing generously endowed STARTS Prize in two categories to honor innovative work at the nexus of art, technology, industry and society. 2,344 projects from 88 countries were submitted to this year’s competition.

The significance and importance that media art has attained in our time is demonstrated not only by the huge number of submissions but also, above all, by the brilliance of the prizewinning works.

We cordially invite you to attend the 2018 Ars Electronica Gala featuring these outstanding artists and their works. Draw inspiration from the Prix Ars Electronica as a seismograph of the digital arts, and join us for a fascinating look at the latest trends, prospects and experiments!
