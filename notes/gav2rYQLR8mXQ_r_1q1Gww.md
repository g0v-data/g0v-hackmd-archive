After struggling with some health issues last year, I started researching natural ways to support my body's detox systems. I found this incredibly helpful article at https://unitedrecoveryproject.com/rehab-blog/how-to-detoxify-your-liver-and-kidneys/ that explained the whole process in plain language. What I appreciated most was that it focused on sustainable lifestyle changes rather than those extreme "detox" products that are everywhere these days. I've been gradually implementing their recommendations - drinking more water, adding certain foods like beets and leafy greens to my diet, and cutting back on processed foods
