citizen feedback mobile app
inspired by tripadvisor, ebay, airbnb
"open consumer feedback"

- citizen controlled (cannot turn off)
- feedback open
    - what open and what not? sensative careful thinking
- real-time

case: earthquake resistant secondary schools in armenia

7 countries now in Africa & Asia

steps
- citizens engaged
    - diversity
- citizens trained
    - not anyone can be a monitor automatically
    - believe citizens can be great if basic knowledge
- minotor visit project & report problem
    - access of info
    - contract
    - "bill of quantity"
    - display life [DevelopmentCheck](https://www.developmentcheck.org/) website
- minotor speak with community about experiences
- minotors talk with svc providers 
- check if solutions is delivered
- report solutions => "DevelopmentCheck"

now most projects are secondary schools & svc providers

now independent of gov

challenges: sustainablity

Quick question: how ppl incentivite
Not a big problem

supported heavily by the ADB

## Ani

## Aida

citizen participatory audit (CPA)
citizen feedback component

CPA: COA + citvil society
> COA (Commision of audit)
also a reform streatgy
vigilant & involved citizenry

"CPA Dialog"
1 day sit down talking
outcome:
1. audit topics recommended by citizens
2. audit objectives recommended by citizens
citizens are better to design questionnairs than gov

"Citizen's desk" in coa website
with support of public info sys (PIS)
public feedback via website, phone calls, letter, face-to-face reports 
=> ticket in PIS

Major challenge: managing public expectation = 100% action

## Enkhbat
advisort to the auditor general of mongolia
National audit office (NAO)

Mongolia constitution: the people shall exercise state power thru their direct participation

Signed MOU between NAO and Open Society Forum for citizen participatory audit 2018/9

Q: how do you control quality of outcome of the citizen audit group?

## Deep dive

### Pomin
problem solving
1. monitor + construction workers
    - solve problem on the spot (monitors thought of this)
2. JWG
3. HLWG

look for existing WG/committee/discussion forum...

### Antonette Torres (gov PH)
incentivizing?
"job experience", certificate
"touch the point" when lobby the people 

didnot believe in the beginning

digital platform
Integrity Action working with other tech company
[young innovations Nepal](http://younginnovations.com.np/)

app is not open-source yet

### Jeon (gov, student, Korea)

JWG meets every month

tech platform is not the main platform
monitor faciliating solution is better, faster, more empowering

### Torplus Yomnak (researcher, Thailand)

start with small area, one small sector
8 school in Armenia

### Naira Arakelyan (Armenia)
executive director

when start its a new culture for the gov
they consider construction is a closed thing so citizens cannot go there
gov always ask us if your not engineers/... how can you give feedback
when implementing proved problems/issues citizens can see
gov is high up, citizens is on the ground
tell gov its also good for you

one of the school outside the capital
contructor did not receive fund and monitors also recorded this problem

"the connecting link" for finding solution

invited high level gov official to meet with monitors

### Torplus
commenting project 2800 comment 1 month
"too successful"
gov took it took the name and do it themselves

### Derek
"Fix My Street"
local councils pay them to get feedback from citizens

### Pomin
use set of law to ensure the independence of the org

example in France
