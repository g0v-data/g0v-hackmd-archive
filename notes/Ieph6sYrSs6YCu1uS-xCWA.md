I bought my first skin yesterday and it's so cool seeing it in game! I got a blue AK skin for like $3 and it makes the gun look way better than the default boring one. My friend told me about different skin qualities - some look brand new and others look worn out. The new ones cost more money obviously. I'm saving up for a knife skin next because those look really awesome. There's good info about all the different skins at https://dmarket.com/cs2-wiki/ if you want to learn more. Now I understand why people spend money on these - it makes the game way more fun when your weapons look cool
