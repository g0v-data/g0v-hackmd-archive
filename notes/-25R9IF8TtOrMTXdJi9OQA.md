## background: online participation ineqality
* steward brand: digital utopia
* participants backgrounds
    * gender
    * education
    * multi-dimentional
## inequalness: who decides the community goes
* edits of wikipedia: vulunteer community contribution 
    * example: feeding homeless
        * long-tale distribution
* organizational analysis within community
* political group in mexico
    * wikipartido: open collaboration apply to political field
    * inheritly democratic
* open online communities online as democratic organizations
    * horizontal interaction

## 研究案例 
* wikia
    * many wikis: [seattle](http://seattle.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page), starbucks, [star wars](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page), academia job sharing
* differenciation by software: 權限管理
    * 不是真的完全 horizontal
    * what's the distribution of participation
* two studies about hierarchy: 
    * administrator: 
        * originial admin 越來越不活躍
        * when communities add new admins? the answer is....no 
        * who contributed to discussion of communities governance: admins....
        * how admin use their power:
    * newbies: without newbies, community long-term survival, need to mobilize newbies
        * when to stick around: 用貢獻紀錄資料視覺化、分析
        * not easy to survive as the community grows
    * 小結論：老人不肯放權，新手進入門檻越
    * 
    * 來越高....
* ? (好像很慘，怎麼辦....what's next)
    * rethinkging participation inequalities online
        * produce valuable shared resources 盡量開放
            * openness
        * protect valuable shared resources
            * autonomous governance
                * responding to threats
                * poinsoning the commjnities
            * by creating structure, creating rules and roles

    * introducing new tools, software: visual editor 
        * experienced commmunity members hated it: wikipedia shut it down
        * communities must manage tradeoffs between openness & closure over time
* digital utopianism runs deep.... (進入深水區?)
    * open conversation, open society, open outcomes 
    * online participation inequlities are multi-dimensional
    * who shows up, who.....
