Hello,

FtO is two days away!

✈️ This FtO is in Tainan, not Taipei. Transportation guide can be found here. https://g0v.hackmd.io/O-Yj2fBPREefIHQFOEyfYQ (It’s under the “Transportation” section.) (tmonk++)

🛏 Check-in at CAOJI Book Inn
- Check-in before Welcome Party
    - Dec 20 (Fri) ==16:00-17:30==
    - Find @isabel at CAOJI Book Inn
    - You can drop your bags at the inn
- Check-in after Welcome Party
    - Find your roommate at the party :)

💚 Bring your own utensil! Bowl, cup, spoon, chopsticks, bring what you use with you to the Welcome Party & through out the event. Let’s reduce trash together.

💻 Bring your laptop! It’s useful for doing research, taking notes, making drawings, writing code.

☀️ Pack a light jacket :) In winter time, Tainan is typically hot (& sunny) in the day (~25°C) and chilly at night with a ~10°C difference. Event venue also has AC.

💞 Mutual respect is REQUIRED at any FtO event. Read through and follow g0v’s Code of Conduct during this FtO event. https://g0v.hackmd.io/COC

Event info: https://tinyurl.com/ftofto. If you have any question, find us on g0v’s Slack the #intl channel (https://join.g0v.tw/), or email to facing-the-ocean-organizers@googlegroups.com.

Looking forward to seeing you in Tainan!
