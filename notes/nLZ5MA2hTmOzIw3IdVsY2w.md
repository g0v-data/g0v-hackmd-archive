# 2. Conditions of the Handbook
- the structure of student association in the individual school and across schools
- Students' web3 knowledge and the ability to acquire a wallet

## Engagement Level of Students
The engagement level of a student association is usually low, so we have to find a way to motivate student to actively participate and foster their interest and willingness to self-governance. The transparency and public accessible feature of blockchain guarantees that students have a comprehensive understanding of operational and decision-making process of a DAO and encourage them to participate in the discussion and voting proactively. By the transparent information sharing and regular meeting, student can feel that their voice are heard and valued.
