### Go to Cofacts' Fact-Check Website.

## Empowerment

Despite most having the ability to research and verify, individuals are at risk of receiving scams from LINE chat bots. Said individuals might find it tedious to search up the correct information in order to respond which leads to them giving up. 

Cofacts is a collaborative effort by these individuals to put up a shield against these false messages. The Cofacts chatbot overlooks queries for clarification on misinformation, allows complaints to be submitted, and feeds information that needs to be verified for the public database.

Cofacts also organizes fact-checking workshops and training opportunities for fact-checkers. This is done for everyone to work together and not alone. 



Information collected by Cofacts, the responses written by fact-checkers, and the frequency of specific misinformation are not only shared by Cofacts fact-checkers, but are also open to the public. 

Cofacts gathers information from all sides of the community, receives feedback from the public, and then distributes under the CC liscense. This allows third-party chat bots, investigative journalists, and research institutions to use it to serve a wider audience and create more possibilities. 

As of 2023, Cofacts is the only open source system that combines a chatbot, public reporting, and open responses. Anyone can use Cofacts' code to build their own open-source system and run their own community. 



## Sustainability 

We invite you to join the team! We need to eliminate the potential damage misinformation can bring to the community!

Participate and contribute! Make the project long-lasting! 


### Our Partners


### Generous Donators 


### RSS Reading Ability
Our database has a large quantity of material, so we use a subscription system to help link up to IFTTT and find popular topics. Then it links up to LINE, telegram, Slack, and your personal email to send reminders that vertification is underway. 

### LINE Notification
Traditional chatbots can only report information that has already been verified, but now when one tries to check a non-yet verified piece of information, the system can send a notification when the information has been verified. If a better response has since been provided, the system can also send a notification to ensure that information provided is always the most up-to-date.


### Users can easily check on prior information 
You can access the list of rumours that have already been checked, and the chatbot can help you organize your own table of information and help produce personalized information.

### The UI of the new website
The site now has gamified features and it is now easier to see the contribution of each collaborator. Plus, we now have data visualization and the tools to see what material has been accessed by journalists and the process of verification for each article.

### AI Automatic Categorization 
We use machine learning technology to help categorize our data. The technology is capable of correctly labeling messages as being about politics, scams, the environment, energy, amongst others. This helps doctors or journalists quickly find messages relating to their areas of expertise to help with message verification.

### Community Builders 
We help community organizers to efficiently check up on current work progress, the quantity of messages, the positive reviews under the review mechanism, the list of contributors who helped with the output, and the review of response and user feedback from a particular period.

### The Ecology of Fact-Checking 
We collaborate with all fact-checking organizations and help them enter the fact-checking community by setting aside their competition and rivalry. Encouraging them to work together to help create the largest datasets possible.

### Teaching Tools 
Cofacts helps educators the ability to create their own chatbots with search capabilities. We provide free consultancy and assistance to our international collaborators to help the open source community grow. Thailand has already successfully replicated Cofacts' experience to create their own search chatbot based on Cofacts.

### User Feedback 
We collected user feedback and encourage users to cooperate with us to create a better open source environment in which many can use our resources. In addition, by encouraging user feedback and collaboration, our collaborators can use this feedback to help improve their user experience.

### Data
Cofacts provides a chart explaining how to link the chatbot to a website as a way to help researchers and journalists follow important topics and write impactful reports. There have already been many global academics who have quoted this data, and many have directly accessed material from Cofacts' open database.
