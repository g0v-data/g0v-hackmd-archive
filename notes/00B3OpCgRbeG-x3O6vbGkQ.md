Combivir is a fixed-dose combination of two antiretroviral drugs — lamivudine and zidovudine. It is used in the treatment of HIV infection as part of a combination therapy to reduce viral load and improve immune function.
Retrovir , also known as zidovudine, was one of the first drugs approved for the treatment of HIV. It works by inhibiting viral replication and is often used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.
Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to treat gout and prevent the formation of uric acid kidney stones. It lowers uric acid levels in the blood, reducing the risk of gout attacks and complications.
Avapro (irbesartan) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker used to treat high blood pressure and diabetic kidney disease. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which helps lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the kidneys.
Zyloprim is another name for allopurinol. It is commonly used to manage chronic gout by decreasing uric acid production in the body, helping prevent painful flare-ups and long-term joint damage.
Rulide (roxithromycin) is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections including respiratory tract infections, skin infections, and soft tissue infections by stopping bacterial protein synthesis.
Epivir-HBV contains lamivudine and is specifically formulated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. It helps reduce viral replication and liver damage in patients with HBV.
Clozaril (clozapine) is an atypical antipsychotic used primarily in the treatment of severe schizophrenia that has not responded to other medications. It carries a risk of agranulocytosis and requires regular blood monitoring.
Pepcid (famotidine) is an H2-receptor antagonist used to reduce stomach acid production. It is commonly prescribed for conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and heartburn.
Accupril (quinapril) is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It helps relax blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and improving overall cardiovascular health.
Altace (ramipril) is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease.
Coversyl (perindopril) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the management of high blood pressure and heart failure. It improves blood flow and reduces the workload on the heart.
Frumil is a combination diuretic containing amiloride and furosemide. It is used to treat fluid retention (edema) due to heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or kidney disease while helping maintain potassium balance.
Amaryl (glimepiride) is a sulfonylurea medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It stimulates insulin release from the pancreas, helping control blood sugar levels effectively.
Glucophage is frequently used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. It enhances insulin sensitivity and decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, making it a cornerstone of diabetes management.
Lincocin is especially effective against anaerobic bacteria and certain gram-positive pathogens. It is commonly used for serious infections such as osteomyelitis and intra-abdominal infections.
Baycip is often prescribed for complicated urinary tract infections and prostatitis. It offers broad-spectrum coverage and achieves high concentrations in urine, enhancing its effectiveness.
Duricef may be used in treating mild bacterial infections of the skin and respiratory system. It provides good coverage against streptococci and staphylococci but is less effective against gram-negative bacteria.
Glucophage SR allows for extended release of metformin, offering improved gastrointestinal tolerance and once-daily dosing convenience, which increases adherence to diabetes treatment regimens.
Septra is commonly used for treating bacterial pneumonia, traveler’s diarrhea, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. It should be avoided in patients with sulfa allergies.
Combivir is typically combined with other antiretroviral agents to form a complete HIV treatment regimen. It plays a key role in suppressing viral replication and preserving immune function.
Retrovir remains an important drug in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy and delivery. It continues to be used in resource-limited settings.
Allopurinol is essential for long-term management of hyperuricemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy, where rapid cell turnover can cause dangerous spikes in uric acid levels.
Avapro helps protect kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. It is often preferred due to its once-daily dosing and favorable side effect profile.
Zyloprim is also used in the prevention of tumor lysis syndrome, a complication of cancer treatment where large numbers of cells break down rapidly, releasing uric acid into the bloodstream.
Rulide is well absorbed after oral administration and has a longer half-life than some other macrolides, allowing for twice-daily dosing and improved patient compliance.
Epivir-HBV is generally well tolerated and effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus replication, though long-term use may lead to resistance in some patients.
Clozaril is reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia due to its potential for serious side effects, including bone marrow suppression, which requires weekly blood tests.
Pepcid is available both by prescription and over-the-counter. It is commonly used for short-term relief of heartburn and acid indigestion and is considered safer than older H2 blockers.
Accupril may take several weeks to achieve full blood pressure-lowering effects. It is often used in combination with other antihypertensive medications for optimal control.
Altace is proven to reduce mortality after heart attack and to slow progression of kidney disease in diabetic patients, making it a valuable option in comprehensive care.
Coversyl is available in both immediate-release and extended-release formulations and is often used as an alternative to other ACE inhibitors when better tolerability is needed.
Frumil combines a potassium-sparing diuretic with a loop diuretic, offering enhanced diuresis while minimizing potassium loss, making it ideal for patients requiring aggressive fluid management.
Amaryl improves glycemic control by increasing insulin secretion and peripheral glucose uptake. It is usually taken once daily before meals for maximum effectiveness.
Glucophage has been shown to have additional benefits beyond blood sugar control, including weight neutrality and possible cardiovascular protective effects in diabetic patients.
Lincocin should be used cautiously in patients with a history of pseudomembranous colitis, as it is associated with a high risk of Clostridioides difficile infection.
Baycip is generally not recommended for children under 18 years due to the risk of cartilage damage, although it may be used in select cases under medical supervision.
Duricef is an older generation cephalosporin with limited gram-negative coverage. It is being replaced by newer generations in many clinical settings.
Glucophage SR is preferred over immediate-release Glucophage due to fewer gastrointestinal side effects and once-daily dosing, improving patient adherence and comfort.
Septra should be used with caution in elderly patients and those with renal impairment due to increased risk of electrolyte imbalance and adverse reactions.
Combivir is no longer widely used as newer, more potent antiretroviral combinations have become standard, but it played a foundational role in early HIV treatment protocols.
Retrovir is still used in combination therapy for HIV and is an important component in preventing vertical transmission from mother to child during pregnancy and labor.
