# g0ver @ Forum for Social Practice in Art/Media ‘Cultural Resistance in the Post-Open Data Age’

## 簡介 Intro

### 緣起 Why

Bess (g0v-jothon) 收到 Arts Council Tokyo 的山峰潤也先生邀請，將在日本東京的東京都寫真美術館介紹 g0v，主題將著重在社群與社會的關係。這次邀約是因為山峰潤也先生之前在台北駐村的時候，就有聽過 g0v 這個社群，不過當時還沒有合作機會。回到日本之後，他到了 Arts Council Tokyo 工作，開始討論科技、藝術與社會之間的關係，因此又想起 g0v （尤其是之前得到林茲電子藝術大獎），才透過藝術村的人脈找到了 Bess，串起這次的邀約。

:::warning
（更新）主辦單位在 12/4 寄來的更多問題（以下）
:::

### How did g0v make the infrastructure of the community when g0v start the project. I guess the first progress is quite difficult because people don’t know your method and the influence of the project yet. We are interested in how did you start up in what kind of start line? How did g0v share visions with the people?


### Why g0v is the anonymous community?
- It’s perhaps semi-anonymous?
- You can use your real name if you want.

### Why did g0v choose the style of hackthon?
- Because it’s more about making things. Because of the bi-monthly hackathons, people do end up knowing each other I think.
- 

### What kind of change was happened to g0v after the Sunflower Movement. What is the change of before/after?  As long as my understanding, g0v worked as for the resistance against the old government but now it has been changed. What kind of discussion had happened at that timing? And also, I’d appreciate it if you introduce the projects after the change of the government such as the vTaiwan.
- The Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement was blocked
- Many people joined g0v’s hackathons
- 

### I think it is not easy to keep to motivate the community but g0v looks quite active. How g0v motivates the people?
- Pizza & fried chicken
- Machine-readable data sets
- Not really active?

### What kind of way do you have to protect the community from the antis.
- What’s antis?
- 黑特？ If you don't like what we do, then you can do it by your own way. That is okay.

### What drives g0v’s motivation. How g0v motivates the participants.
- Pizza & friend chicken
- Food, friend, humors?

### I know the community of g0v became quite big but I’d like you to talk about the social influence of your projects or responses from the people.
- It’s better to ask the project themselves?
- I wrote [this](https://taiwaninsight.org/2019/12/06/a-strong-democracy-is-a-democracy-rooted-in-communities/). Third paragraph.
- 

### And what was difficult on your experience through the activities of g0v.
- Tech first versus human first.
- Crowd first versus professionals first.
- 

### What do you think the meaning to show your projects in the art circle.
- Community-building is the most relevant contemporary art.
- Art circle need to know the real situation of society.
