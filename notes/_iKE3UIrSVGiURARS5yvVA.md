# g0v X Won

**CC BY 4.0 by Jungwon Shin & g0v contributors**

Hello!

I’m Jungwon Shin, an undergraduate student from Korea University, who attended the g0v hackathon last August.
In this semester at Korea University School of Media and Communication, I’m in a class named ‘Investigative Reporting(探査企劃報道)’, in which for the mid-term I have to write a news article and upload it to a Korean news magazine, but it’s unsure whether it would be able to be uploaded or not since I’m an undergrad student, not a professional journalist.

Regardless of whether it could be uploaded, I want to write an article about g0v and CodeforKorea for this mid-term project of mine! Here, I think all of your experience in August's g0v hackathon would truly stimulate Korean readers' interest.

So I am asking you if you agree for me to have an interview with you here and try to publish an article about g0v  in a Korean news magazine. If you’re worried about your identity being shown in a public space, you’re all welcome to deny my request!

Thanks!

Before we begin...
---
- Can you share your identity info - including your name(not your nickname), job, and age - to my article? I’m asking this importantly since my article cannot quote anonymous sources due to the journalism standards!
** If available, please send your identity info to Won on g0v Slack channel or just e-mail me to garden0812@korea.ac.kr
** If unavailable, you can freely deny my interview request. Please just text me via Slack(Won on g0v) or e-mail me on the address above!

Questions
---
- How come did you participate in g0v?
- What is your job? Is your personal job related to g0v? If not, why are you contributing to g0v even though g0v doesn’t give you any money?
- Would you introduce your project briefly in one or two sentences?
- Are there any difficulties when working in your project?
- I saw the g0v contributors in-person for the first time at g0v hackathon last August (26th at Academia Sinica). What was your project's 3-min pitch about? Then exactly what project did you work on at the hackathon?
- Could you give me your feelings or takeaways about the g0v hackathon last August?

Thank you for answering,
and hope to see you guys again in this small world:)

Sincerely,
Jungwon

    - Project: 公有地大行動
        - 多數的縣市政府，資料未開放
        - 其中有一份涵蓋全國的國有地資料，資料釋出但存在著難以應用的狀況，因為這份國有土地資料，被拆分成一份輪廓資料，與一份描述資料，兩個資料集需要民間自己整合，必須具備較專業的程式處理技能才有可處理資料
    - Project: 資料申請小幫手
        - 專案有成功與政府資料平台合作，讓資料能否開放的政府機關回覆內容，採用選項勾選方式
        - 透過參加總統盃黑客松，建立與平台營運單位的溝通管道，歸納回覆內容的分類方式，輔助政府單位納入平台運作的機制之中
- I saw the g0v contributors in-person for the first time at g0v hackathon last August (26th at Academia Sinica). What was your project’s 3-min pitch about? Then exactly what project did you work on at the hackathon?
    - Project: Joinplus
        - 當天邀請大家來實際試用 Collage 工具，這是由社群參與者 任翔 所開發的網頁工具，可以讓網頁使用者創作出一幅空間願景圖像，我們當天提供兩個地點圖像，請大家創作空間改造願景方案，一個是總統府前廣場，另一個是花博會展公共空間
            - 補圖片：(to be done)
        - 在成果報告時，我們展示了當天創作者們的成果，也提出針對不同的空間願景方案表達成果，可以透過物件元素被重複使用的次數、物件元素被放置的位置等綜合歸納與分析方式，來取得可以做為公眾對於此空間改造構想的要點
- Could you give me your feelings or takeaways about the g0v hackathon last August?
    - 有收穫的 (to be done)
