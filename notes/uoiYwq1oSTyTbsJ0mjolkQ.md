I've been betting on local football matches for a few months now and it makes watching games way more exciting. Started with the [1xbet promo code bonus codes](https://1-xbet-tz.com/promo-code/) which gave me extra to work with when learning. My strategy is pretty basic - I bet on teams I watch regularly so I know if they're in good form or struggling. Tanzanian league is my main focus because those are the matches I never miss on weekends. Sometimes I bet live during games if I see one team pressuring a lot and looking likely to score. Other times I just do simple pre-match bets on who wins. European leagues are okay too but I stick mostly to the big matches. Still learning what works best but keeping bets small while figuring things out
