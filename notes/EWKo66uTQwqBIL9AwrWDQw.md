Instagram growth platforms promise quick results but the quality of followers varies a lot. I tested one last year to see if it was worth the money and got mixed results. Numbers went up fast like they said but engagement stayed pretty flat because most accounts weren't real people. Customer support was okay when I had questions about delivery times. Looking at the [GoRead Sitejabber review](https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/goread.io) helped me set realistic expectations before spending anything. Price was lower than competitors but that usually means lower quality followers. If you just want your account to look bigger for credibility it does that but don't count on those followers to actually interact with your posts. Better to use it as a one-time thing rather than rely on it for long-term growth
