## Statement

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) targeted the fact-checking project for an audit under the pretext of a comprehensive audit of the Viewer Media Foundation, imposing a recovery amount and fines exceeding 750 million won on Parti. In the audit report, the KCC labeled Parti as an "organization misusing personnel expenses," claiming that "personnel costs were used for purposes other than intended," and released the audit results without reflecting the explanations from the audited organization.

Media outlets such as Chosun Ilbo, KBS, Yonhap News TV, SBS, Free Journal, and Digital Daily reported the KCC's press release without any additional investigation. During the reporting process, there was no effort to ensure the right of reply for the parties involved, such as FactCheckNet and Parti. As a result, the KCC's unilateral claims spread as if they were factual.

In particular, Chosun Ilbo distorted the contents of the KCC's press release and reported false information. Chosun Ilbo stated, "In the case of the development manager, Mr. Kim, his salary in December 2021 was 5.3 million won, but it was reported that he was actually paid 9.2 million won based on the average salary of IT planners," implying that a higher salary was paid than what was actually reported. Based on this, the headline of the report described it as "Personnel Costs Doubled," portraying it as a serious misconduct.

Chosun Ilbo's claims are clearly false. The KCC explicitly stated in the press release that "the actual monthly salary is 5.3 million won, yet the average salary of IT planners was applied to calculate the standard salary as 9.2 million won." This means that the KCC applied the average salary criteria for software engineers, not that an actual salary of 9.2 million won was paid. Nowhere in the KCC's press release does it state that 9.2 million won was paid.

I will ask Chosun Ilbo: What is the basis for claiming that Parti inflated personnel costs by double? Aside from reprinting the KCC's press release and distorting it, what investigation did you conduct to verify the claim of double inflation of personnel costs? Did you consider the potential stigma that expressions like "double inflation of personnel costs" could impose on the parties involved while writing the article?

Parti determined the personnel costs for the project based on the criteria presented by the KCC and the Viewer Media Foundation. Furthermore, all personnel costs calculated according to the criteria were fully paid to the activists within their actual salaries. After the project concluded, Parti submitted a settlement report containing details of the personnel cost payments, and no issues were raised. Throughout the audit, Parti continuously clarified that "the determination of personnel costs was made according to the criteria, and all personnel costs were paid as actual salaries." However, the KCC ignored this. If Chosun Ilbo had investigated these details, would they have been able to mention terms like "double inflation of personnel costs"?

Recently, after it became known that the KCC imposed fines on Parti, criticisms such as "targeted audit" and "hasty administration" have emerged. The KCC's audit results and press release explicitly mention the "fact-checking project," and it was a well-known fact that this project involved FactCheckNet and others. If the media outlets, including Chosun Ilbo, that merely reprinted the KCC's press release had guaranteed the right of reply to Parti even once and attempted to investigate, such criticisms would have arisen much earlier.

Parti demands a correction from Chosun Ilbo and a right of reply report from the media that reprinted the KCC's press release without any investigation. In particular, Chosun Ilbo, which distorted the expression "double inflation of personnel costs" and misrepresented the term "calculation" in the audit results as "payment" without any investigation, must correct the report that stigmatizes Parti as an organization misusing personnel costs. If there is no correction, we will have no choice but to hold legal responsibility for damaging Parti's reputation under civil law.

## Press Release

Parti Requests Correction from Media, Including Chosun Ilbo, for Distorting the KCC's Announcement

    Media that unilaterally reprinted claims without investigation must ensure correction and right of reply.
    Chosun Ilbo reported clear falsehoods not found in the KCC's press release.

The social cooperative Parti (Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun) has requested a right of reply report from media outlets that reported the KCC's fact-checking project audit results without investigation. They demanded that Chosun Ilbo, which reported false information not included in the KCC's press release, correct the distorted report, stating that if a correction is not made, they will have no choice but to hold legal responsibility.

The media outlets that Parti is requesting a right of reply from include Chosun Ilbo, KBS, Yonhap News TV, and SBS. These outlets reported the content of the KCC's press release, titled "KCC Announces Audit Results of the Fact-Checking Project," on January 18, 2024, without verifying the claims.

In the case of Chosun Ilbo, it reported that "in the case of the development manager, Mr. Kim, his salary in December 2021 was 5.3 million won, but it was reported that he was actually paid 9.2 million won based on the average salary of IT planners," implying that Parti inflated the salary. However, the KCC's press release only contained criticisms regarding the calculation of personnel costs and did not state that the amount was actually paid.

Parti explained in a statement that "throughout the audit, Parti continuously clarified that 'the determination of personnel costs was made according to the criteria, and all personnel costs were paid as actual salaries,' but the KCC ignored this," indicating that Parti's explanations were not reflected in the KCC's audit.

Furthermore, Parti pointed out that "Chosun Ilbo, KBS, Yonhap News TV, SBS, Free Journal, and Digital Daily reported the KCC's press release without any additional investigation," thereby failing to guarantee the right of reply for the parties involved, such as FactCheckNet and the social cooperative Parti.

Parti has communicated to the media that reported the information to ensure the right of reply. In particular, they demanded a correction from Chosun Ilbo, which reported information not found in the press release, asking, "What is the basis for claiming that Parti inflated personnel costs by double?" They warned that if no correction is made, they will pursue legal action.

Kwon Oh-hyun, Chairman of the social cooperative Parti, stated, "The KCC conducted the audit unilaterally, and Parti's explanations were not reflected at all. Nevertheless, the KCC's audit results were conveyed to various media outlets. It is only right to guarantee proper rights of reply and correct distorted reports," urging the media to ensure the right of reply and issue corrections.
