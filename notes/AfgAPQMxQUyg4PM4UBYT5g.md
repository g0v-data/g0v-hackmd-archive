# Making Dashboards Work for Procurement Teams
Dashboards are often praised for improving decision-making, but only if they’re simple enough to use daily. Teams don’t need another tool that complicates their workflows—they need something that highlights what matters. A great example is [precoro](https://precoro.com/blog/procurement-reporting-and-dashboards/).With Precoro, you can track spending patterns, approvals, and vendor performance without getting overwhelmed. It provides clear visuals that let you identify potential issues early, whether it’s overspending or delays in the approval process. The best part? Teams can adopt it quickly without the need for extensive training. If your current tools feel like more trouble than they’re worth, this platform is definitely worth considering.
