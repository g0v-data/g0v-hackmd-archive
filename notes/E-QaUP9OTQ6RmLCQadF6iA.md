# FtO Community Contact - follow-up letter

Hi all,

Hope everyone is doing well back to daily life after the magic weekend at Koza. Here’s some follow-ups from FtO organizers,

## About the FtO Album:

Hal has created a [FtO Album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/brtc4uj7uJAboRPD7) for all of us to share the photos at the FtO. Here are some important reminders about uploading and downloading the photos for further use.

* If you are going to download and use the photos from the FtO album, please check the license of the photo before doing so. The licenses used by each participant respectively is listed in the [Photo License Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZoMqFxLmXyf4CDSAsvcThcuz8cffj0CGbZTkG1SB6hg/edit#gid=628453658).

* If you already uploaded photos or about to do so, please let us know the copyright license you prefer for your photos by signing up in the [Photo License Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZoMqFxLmXyf4CDSAsvcThcuz8cffj0CGbZTkG1SB6hg/edit#gid=628453658). We encourage you to use a [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) so other participants can make the most of your photos to share FtO experiences.

* If you have uploaded photos and do not want them to be published, please delete the photos from the FtO album before Jun 16th.

* If your face or figure is photoed and you don’t want the pictures of you to be published, please inform the organizers before Jun 16th.

## About Retro:

Nao has created a [Retro Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZoMqFxLmXyf4CDSAsvcThcuz8cffj0CGbZTkG1SB6hg/edit#gid=739912923) and please give us your 5 mins and leave your comments on the sheet.

Row is the evaluation or the  feeling of comments. Please pick a column based on your comment. Fresh memory is important, so there is a deadline for the retro, Jun 16th Sunday night. We are looking forward to seeing your comment. Your comments are very important for the future event.

## About Keeping in touch:

Organizers from Taiwan have created a Telegram group. Most participants are already in it. If you are not and want to join, please ask a fellow participant or an organizer.

Ipa has created a [People Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZoMqFxLmXyf4CDSAsvcThcuz8cffj0CGbZTkG1SB6hg/edit#gid=739912923) for all of participants to know each other better. If you have not filled in your information, please do it. If you want to find information about FtO, please always check the [FtO Info Book](https://g0v.hackmd.io/sKoAWScPRxqizCZVMl7JoQ) or ask in the Telegram group.

We are grateful to have all of you being at the 1st FtO. It is all the participants who made our meet-and-hack so productive, informative, joyful, and unforgetable. Let’s keep connected and happy hacking.
