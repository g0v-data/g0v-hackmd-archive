### TICTeC 2024 Call for Proposals

We invite individuals to submit presentation abstracts or workshop proposals of no more than 300 words by 23.59 GMT 22nd March 2024.

We encourage presentation submissions to focus on the specific impacts of technologies, rather than showcase new tools that are as yet untested. Workshop proposals should be relevant to the conference theme - see more here.

Those selected for inclusion in the conference programme will be notified no later than 5th April 2024.

Presenters will be required to register for the conference by 19th April in order to confirm their slot (the registration fee will be waived for individuals presenting).

The conference, and therefore presentations/workshops, will happen on 12th and 13th June 2024 between 9am and 6pm British Summer Time, so proposers must be available on those dates/times. 

The data collected on this Google form will be used only by mySociety for event communications and logistics in accordance with our privacy policy. We will not share this data with anyone else unless you agree.


### If you'd like to do a presentation, please provide your presentation summary below (300 words maximum)

> Please ensure your summary details what real-world impacts your presentation will discuss. We will prioritise proposals that can demonstrate data or evidence of how civic tech has been impactful in some way. An abstract should include a brief overview of the research/work, the methods used, and the results you plan to share. Narratives or descriptions of tools or services will not be accepted. Please put N/A in the box below if you are proposing a workshop.
