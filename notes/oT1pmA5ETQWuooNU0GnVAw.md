Cofacts Editors’ Gathering Guidelines and Policy
====
We’ve received a ton of feedback like “The gathering is so much fun!” and we’re glad that everyone likes it. It is the work of every one of you, we can all get a good vibe from the gathering. We sincerely hope to keep a comfortable and friendly atmosphere for each one of you, therefore there’s couple of things below we hope you’d keep in mind:

Cofacts team do not tolerate any form of harassment, we call for the participants to work together and respect each other. We all benefit when we create a good vibe and we all need to be obligated to make every participant feels comfortable.


Cofacts is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected categories. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. During the event, any form of harassment is considered inappropriate. Cofacts takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately. This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, social media, parties, hallway conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. Cofacts reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any Cofacts hosted event (including future Cofacts events) at any time in its sole discretion. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.


Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected categories; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. 

If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a staff event member immediately. 

This policy is based on and influenced by several other community policies including: http://2012.jsconf.us/#/about, The Ada Initiative, Google Event Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy, g0v Conference Code of Conduct https://g0v.hackpad.tw/Conference-Code-of-Conduct-x2hZOGaduXC
