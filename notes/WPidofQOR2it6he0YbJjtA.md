Global Rodenticides Market Expected to Reach USD 8.68 Billion by 2031, Growing at a 5.7% CAGR

The global [**Rodenticides Market**](https://www.snsinsider.com/reports/rodenticides-market-3554)is poised for steady growth over the next several years, with the market size valued at USD 5.53 billion in 2023and projected to reach USD 8.68 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.7%from 2024 to 2031. As urbanization, agricultural activities, and food storage requirements increase worldwide, the demand for effective rodent control solutions continues to rise, driving market expansion. Rodenticides are chemicals used to eliminate rodents that pose significant threats to crops, residential areas, and urban infrastructure.

### **Market Overview and Segmentation**

Rodenticides play a crucial role in preventing damage caused by rodents, which includes the destruction of crops, contamination of food, and structural damage to buildings. The rising population and urbanization have resulted in the expansion of residential and commercial spaces, which has escalated the need for rodent control measures. Moreover, the growth of agricultural activities globally has led to an increased demand for rodenticides to protect crops from rodents.

The rodenticides market is segmented by **type**, **rodent type**, **mode of application**, **end-use**, and **region**.

#### **By Type**

- **Anticoagulants**: Anticoagulant rodenticides are the most widely used, functioning by preventing the clotting of blood in rodents, leading to internal bleeding and death. These include first-generation anticoagulants like warfarin and second-generation anticoagulants like brodifacoum and difethialone. They are highly effective and work over an extended period, ensuring the gradual elimination of rodent populations.

- **Non-anticoagulants**: Non-anticoagulant rodenticides work by disrupting vital physiological functions in rodents, such as calcium regulation or cellular metabolism. These rodenticides, including bromethalin and zinc phosphide, are used in cases where resistance to anticoagulants has developed or where rapid action is required.

#### **By Rodent Type**

- **Mice**: Mice infestations are a major concern in residential and commercial areas. Rodenticides aimed at mice are commonly used in urban centers and warehouses to prevent contamination and damage.

- **Rat**: Rats are known for causing significant damage in agricultural fields and food storage facilities. The use of rodenticides targeting rat infestations is crucial in preventing crop loss and contamination of stored products.

- **Chipmunk**: Although less common, chipmunks can cause damage to crops and gardens. Rodenticides designed for chipmunks are gaining traction in specific regions with high chipmunk populations.

- **Hamster**: Hamster control is more niche, primarily focused on agricultural settings where these small rodents may cause minor damage.

- **Other Rodents**: Other rodent types, such as squirrels and beavers, also pose risks in certain areas, and specific rodenticides are developed for controlling these populations.

#### **By Mode of Application**

- **Spray**: Rodenticide sprays are commonly used in agricultural fields and warehouses. They offer easy application over a wide area and can be used in combination with other pest control methods.

- **Powder**: Powders are typically used in confined spaces such as storage facilities and residential areas. They are effective in preventing rodents from entering sensitive areas.

- **Pellet**: Pellet rodenticides are widely used due to their convenience and ability to be placed in targeted locations such as bait stations. They are particularly effective for large infestations in agricultural fields and urban centers.

- **Others**: Other application methods, including liquids and bait blocks, are also used depending on the situation and the type of rodent being targeted.

#### **By End-Use**

- **Agricultural Fields**: Agriculture remains a key sector driving the demand for rodenticides. Farmers use rodenticides to protect crops from rodent damage, ensuring the security of their yields and preventing significant financial losses.

- **Pest Control Companies**: Pest control companies are among the largest users of rodenticides, as they provide services to residential, commercial, and industrial clients facing rodent infestations.

- **Warehouses**: Warehouses, particularly those storing food and agricultural products, face a high risk of rodent infestation. Rodenticides play a critical role in preventing contamination and ensuring the safe storage of goods.

- **Urban Centers**: In densely populated urban areas, rodent control is essential to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of diseases. Rodenticides are used extensively by municipalities and property management companies to manage rodent populations.

- **Residential**: Homeowners are also significant consumers of rodenticides, as they seek to protect their homes from rodents that can cause structural damage and pose health risks.

- **Commercial**: Commercial properties, including restaurants, hotels, and retail spaces, use rodenticides to ensure a clean and safe environment for their customers and staff.

### **Market Drivers**

Several factors are contributing to the growth of the global rodenticides market:

l **Increasing Urbanization and Population Growth**\
As cities expand and populations grow, the pressure on urban infrastructure increases, leading to higher incidences of rodent infestations. This drives the demand for effective rodent control solutions, particularly in residential and commercial sectors.

l **Rising Agricultural Activities**\
The global expansion of agricultural activities, especially in developing countries, has resulted in increased demand for rodenticides to protect crops from rodent damage. Rodents pose a significant threat to crop yields, leading to the widespread adoption of rodenticides in this sector.

l **Growing Awareness of Rodent-borne Diseases**\
There is growing awareness of the health risks associated with rodents, including the transmission of diseases such as leptospirosis, hantavirus, and salmonella. This has led to increased use of rodenticides in both residential and commercial settings to reduce the risk of rodent-borne diseases.

l **Technological Advancements in Rodenticides**\
Advancements in rodenticide formulations, including the development of more targeted and eco-friendly solutions, are contributing to market growth. Companies are focusing on creating safer, more effective rodenticides that minimize environmental impact while delivering results.

### **Recent Developments**

l **Eco-friendly Rodenticides**: Several companies are investing in the development of eco-friendly and non-toxic rodenticides to address growing concerns about environmental and human safety. These products aim to reduce the risk to non-target species and limit chemical residues in the environment.

l **Innovative Application Methods**: Recent innovations include smart bait stations that monitor rodent activity and provide real-time data to pest control companies. These technologies help optimize rodenticide usage and improve the efficiency of pest control efforts.

l **Strategic Partnerships**: Key players in the rodenticides market are forming partnerships with pest control companies to expand their reach and improve distribution networks, ensuring timely access to products in regions facing severe rodent infestations.

### **Conclusion**

The global **Rodenticides Market** is set for sustained growth, driven by rising urbanization, increasing agricultural activities, and growing awareness of rodent-borne diseases. With advancements in rodenticide technology and the development of safer, eco-friendly products, the market is expected to continue expanding, offering promising opportunities for key players in the industry.
