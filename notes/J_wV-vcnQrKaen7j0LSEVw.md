ðŸŽ‰ g0v is turning 10! ðŸŽŠ

The year was 2012. For some, it was the year when the world ends, for others, it was the beginning of a new era. For the g0v community, it is the year when tech nerds in Taiwan called on each other to code and reprogram society, creating more interaction between civic technologies of openness and participation and the government and more possibilities for collaboration.

On October 24, 2012, clkao registered the domain g0v.tw. This October, g0v turns 10 years old. After 50+ hackathons, g0v is no longer 90%+ engineers. The 10,000+ participants forms an ecosystem of g0v, now more diverse than ever.

This October, g0vers are hosting not only Hackath52n + Forum on Saturday Oct. 22, there are also events for this 10th anniversary for g0v on Friday (Oct. 21) and Sunday (Oct. 23). For veteran and newcomers alike, all are welcome to come these events for free food, join projects, share your experience, and celebrate g0vâ€™s 10th birthday!
