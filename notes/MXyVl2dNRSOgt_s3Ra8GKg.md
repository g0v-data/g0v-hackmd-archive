MAMI Takesada

Bio:
Community manager of Code for Japan and she is a PhD student of child development at Osaka Univ.
One of her project is "おうちで時間割 / Study At Home / 在家學習時間表". This app is a new educational platform for students to enjoy studying at home and communicate with teachers smoothly made by Civic Tech.Teachers can create study schedules, study materials and assignments easily on the platform. Then, the teachers can share them with their students. That mitigates schooling issues during the Covid-19 pandemic.
She worked for LITALICO and held Social Fighter Award, the award for the team who work on the social issues in 2018. From 2020, she organized Civictech Challenge Cup U-22 with Code for Japan interns and this year, her team also start Civictech Accelerator Program.
