研究摘要：近年掀起一股公民科技的浪潮，公民科技運用開放資料、關注共眾利益，致力解決公共問題。公民科技由實務社群(Community of Practice)驅動，基於開源軟體的概念，將來自各個領域的志願者聚集起來。永續發展和持續的民眾參與是公民實務社群的關鍵議題，為此，成功的公民科技社群需要精心設計的社群結構和流程以鼓勵公民參與並促進合作。本研究旨在探討公民科技社群採用的結構與協作流程的核心要素，以Wenger的實務社群理論來闡釋個案及發展研究架構。本研究以臺灣著名公民科技社群「g0v零時政府」為研究個案，進行個案研究。g0v為全球前三大開源社群，本研究透過訪談及社開大量豐富之開會記錄、Podcast及刊物等資料，探究g0v如何設計其結構，以支持社群參與者在處理公共問題時能支援社群成員建立共享的目標、社群認同、價值傳統、學習和公共實務的持續性發展。本研究以實務社群的觀點，並藉由個案闡釋探討及推導公民科技社群的運作。本研究結果將能協助民眾、政府和企業了解並學習這種自我治理的有機體所帶來的管理意涵及價值。",""],["",""],["###

This article examines Cofacts, a Taiwan-based fact-checking service that combines a chatbot and a database of fact-checked responses provided by volunteers to help debunk rumors circulated on the messaging app LINE. I argue that Cofacts’s crowdsourcing approach joins what Donna Haraway calls embodied objectivity that insists on “the particularity and embodiment of all vision” to challenge the conventional fact-checking practice that presumes singularity, disembodied objectivity, and authority. Underpinning Cofacts’s fight against online rumors is the intergenerational conflicts that are ingrained in different life experiences, beliefs and values, and expectations of what a good life is. By taking up a technological solution that emphasizes openness, Cofacts opens a space for digital natives to contest what fact is and claim the power of speaking from their parents and the patriarchal society on the one hand and to forge new connections of care and reinitiate conversations that have been barred by the invisible walls of chat rooms and the widening gap of values and beliefs between generations on the other hand."],["- 中文摘要：從2016年「post-truth」的討論到2020年的「infodemic」，網絡謠言似乎變得更加猖獗、有害且難以駁斥。本文探討了Cofacts，一個台灣的事實查核服務，它結合了聊天機器人和由編輯志工提供的事實查核資料庫，來幫助查核在LINE上流傳的謠言。我主張，Cofacts的眾包方法結合了Donna Haraway所稱的即身客觀性 (embodied objectivity)，這種客觀性堅持，知識都有其視角與身體，從來就非普世皆同。透過群眾外包的事實查核機器人，Cofacts從而挑戰傳統事實查核中，認為事實是單一、客觀的並且具有權威的觀點。Cofacts誕生於台灣不同世代之間的衝突，這些衝突源於不同的生活經歷、信仰和價值觀，以及對美好生活的期望。通過採取強調開放性的技術解決方案，Cofacts為數位原住民打開新的政治空間，一方面他們可以在父家長的社會中爭奪對事實的話語權；另一方面，Cofacts的眾包方法也讓數位原住民之間建立新的關懷聯繫，並重新開始因同溫層和世代對立而被阻礙的世代對話。",""],["",""],["",""],["",""],["-",""]]},"vYdTfaYeR7SnIU3zT5evOw":{"content":"##
