Picking a contractor for siding is harder than it seems. I talked to five different companies and got wildly different quotes and timelines. One was too cheap to trust, and another kept trying to upsell things I didn’t need. I finally came across [siding](https://ubrothersconstruction.com/catalog/siding) on the UBrothers Construction site while browsing local options. It helped that their site showed real project photos and pricing ranges, so I had a sense of what I’d be paying before a single call. I booked the estimate, and their team was actually early on install day. It’s been about eight months, and everything still looks perfect—worth the search.
