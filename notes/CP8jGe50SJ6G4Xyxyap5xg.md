Data Governance and Digital Transformation
---

Personal Brief

Used to be a freelancer between 2009-2016. I was providing programming services for small to medium businesses. Then I joined the team in the Ministry of Economic Affairs to explore the possibilities in data economics and bring the hackathon spirit to government-owned businesses. The last position in the government, I worked in Tainan City Government Smart City Office. Was trying to bring more connections between the latest technology and the internal workflow of the Tainan City Government. It's hard to get the deserved income as the one in IT industries for political jobs. So I chose to return to the IT industry at the beginning of this year.

The pros and cons of digital transformation in Taiwan government
--- 

I was borned in the era when Taiwan was trying to transit from autocracy to democracy. We are still in the process now. So you could easily find authoritarianism inside our government. The employees of Taiwan government are still familiar with the top-down culture. They strictly abide by the orders from leaders in their units. It's efficient to be good if the leader want to be good, vice versa.

I think we are the best of the world in talking about digital government. Because most of the employees of Taiwan government have good skills in using digital tools to complete their jobs. For example, most of the calculation jobs are done by spreadsheet software. They know how to use it, or at least know they should find someone to help them using it. They have a positive sense of responsibility to achieve the goals by leaders. That's why we could success in the past, including fighting the COVID-19 recently.

Efficiency is good in Taiwan government. But the authoritarianism also brings some problems, like privacy. In fighting COVID-19, the government tried to link lots of private data to monitor people in higher risk. Only a few people argued the using of data violating the rules of collection. Most people in Taiwan support the government in doing that, as saving the lifes is a good reason in violating rules, or even in violating the laws. In my perspect of view, it's almost out of control.

Without the control, the government may use the data in other purposes or leak the data to the man in the middle. It's fast enough for Taiwan government in using digital tools. We must talk more about why and when to use it. And set more check points before the government could use the data. Congressmans, professionals and more people must get involved. The decision should not be made in the black box.

The normal processes in democratic countries are hard for us. Lots of people in Taiwan still dream of having a perfect leader to solve everything. But what I think that we really need is a perfect system, including the laws, rules and the basic sense as a man in democratic countries.
