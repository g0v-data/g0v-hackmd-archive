## Prorposal 
### Session description (in English) 
In late May 2024, tens of thousands of people gathered outside the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan to protest against parliamentary reform amendments, initiating a social movement called “The Blue Bird Action.” These amendments would significantly increase the powers of legislators, fundamentally affecting Taiwan’s existing constitutional system and separation of powers. Protesters criticized these amendments as undemocratic and opaque, demanding that the legislature withdraw them. The Blue Bird Action showcased a new face of networked movements in Taiwan. Its participants were no longer just social activists, student organizations, or intellectual elites but came from all walks of life, ranging from five-year-old children to eighty-year-old elders, from office workers to parent-child co-learning groups, from fan communities to drag queens. Using The Blue Bird Action as a starting point, this dialogue invites participants to discuss how we can repurpose digital technologies to promote public participation and build inclusive, polycentric movements in the face of profit-driven algorithms and social polarization on social media platforms. Speakers will share experiences from the Blue Bird Action, including using short videos as information media, the support of social movements by online fan communities, educational experiments by parent-child co-learning groups, and how the movement continues in hackathons after leaving the streets. Through this dialogue, we invite participants to join us in considering how movement organizers can “facilitate” rather than “organize” an inclusive movement.


2024年5月下旬，數萬人聚集在台灣立法院外，抗議國會改革修正法案，並展開一場名為「青鳥行動」的社會運動。這些修正案將大幅增加立法委員的權力，並根本地影響台灣現行的憲政體制與權力分立。抗議者批評這些法案並沒有依照民主程序，是黑箱法案，要求國會撤回審查。青鳥行動展示了台灣網絡運動的新面貌。它的參與者不再只是社會運動者、學生組織或知識菁英，而是來自各行各業，從五歲幼兒到八十歲老人，從上班族到自學團體，從追星族到同人社群，從家長到變裝皇后。以青鳥行動為契機，我們在這場對話中將討論在利益導向的平台算法和社會極化的背景下，我們如何重新利用數位科技來促進公共參與，並打造包容且多中心的運動。與談者將分享青鳥行動的經驗，包括以短影音作為資訊媒介、網路粉絲文化對社會運動的支持、自學團體的教育實驗、以及行動如何在離開街頭後繼續在黑客松中延續。透過這場對話，我們邀請參與者和我們一起思考，社運行動者如何「促成」，而非「組織」一場多中心的運動。


### What do you want to learn from participants during the session? 

We hope to gather different strategies, techniques, and mobilization methods from participants in various social movements. By learning from each other's experiences in facing different social and political contexts, we aim to understand how movements can maintain their flexibility, inclusiveness, and polycentric operations while effectively advancing their agendas.

我們希望向參與者收集不同的社會運動策略、技術、與動員的方法，從彼此的經驗中學習面對不同的社會與政治情境，運動如何維持其彈性、包容、和多中心的運作，並且能夠推進議題。

### How will participants continue to contribute and collaborate after the session ends? 

We will use multilingual collaborative documents to continue gathering opinions and ideas. We will invite contributors to engage with us in physical or online exchanges. The collected information will be published through the g0v.tw platform and shared with international and local civil society groups in Taiwan.

我們將會運用多語言的公開共筆繼續收集意見與想法，並在合適的機會，邀請貢獻者和我們進行實體或線上的交流。所收集到的資料會透過台灣零時政府的平台發布，並分享給台灣在地的社會運動團體。
