## Profile: Taiwan

_Although CfA typically emphasize on working with local government, we believe in Taiwan it makes more sense working with the central government primarily, as it's relatively a small place, and most policies are made centrally where local governments are just carrying out the works._

> Brigade names seem to be free-formed, e.g. Open Colorado, Open San Diego 
> [name=Audrey T]

## 2014 Strategic Plan

### Group Description


[g0v.tw](http://g0v.asia/tw) is... (as of 2014Q2)
- a community of deep open-source roots, with:
    -  ~1000 contributors, ~50 daily-active ones, an irc channel of ~200 people
    - 10 major bi-monthly hackathons and ~25 other events
    - ~30 projects, ~20 talks by ~10 speakers, ~20 media coverages
- composed of roughly 40% developers, 30% designers, 30% activists/storytellers
- advocating the open-source collaboration model beyond software development
- decentralized do-acracy

hence, g0v.tw would like to have task force acting as liaison in the community, which will:
- lead  the international  communication efforts
- identify local projects worth sharing and communicate with international network
- share our experiences (collaborating with gov.tw, growing open community) in English
- turn existing projects into internationally reusable components/apps
- connecting projects with public servants in the relevant agencies

This allows us to have a more persistent contact window but still keep the community  loosely-structured and decentralized.

The task force shall elect a primary contact person every 6 month.

### Brigade Team


### Story Teller

    The Storyteller owns the communication streams for their local Brigade. They tell the stories of the Brigade’s impact in their community.

(archived discussion)

> 好像身兼多職耶怎麼辦？選一個簽嗎
> [name=ET B]

> 好像除了 Contact 之外沒有一定要簽什麼

> role 和行事方法是相關的, 所以
> [name=Simon P]

> 1\. 或許可以問他們 local brigade 在小的文化差異下 role 可以有什麼樣的彈性?
> [name=Simon P]

> 2\. 在難以折衝的情況下應該是以我方行事順暢為優先考量?
> [name=Simon P]

> 就直接按照在地方式囉，他們也是自然生成，分類只是比較好說明
> [name=ipa c]

> Delivery  Lead 是 project manager, 管開發時程的, 不太適用g0v的model，除非我們有一個專案加速 Program, 每年挑幾個重點專案，募資加速開發，這時就要有delivery lead.
