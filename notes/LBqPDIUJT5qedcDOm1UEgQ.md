Hi! I am Teemo, responsible for the Health Insurance system and certain aspects of the emergency system at National Taiwan University Hospital, across all its branches. My work involves implementing virtual health insurance cards, LLM (large language model) applications, and Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). I am also a long-term participant in the g0v community and an alumnus of the Taiwan Artificial Intelligence School. My focus lies in the development and governance of large-scale language models in Taiwan. Recently, I have been leading a workshop group on AI consensus collaboration, and I am currently preparing a CC0 dataset for testing and evaluating local LLMs in Taiwan.
