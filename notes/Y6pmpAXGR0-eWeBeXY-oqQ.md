# IORG - Chihhao Yu (chihao)

## [Slides are here 👀](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uP9SSKaNDwirirVuMeMRe7O-lsg5JJuOkqCghNgfxKM/edit#)

## About the speaker...
Hi, I’m Chihhao Yu (chihao is my g0v ID). I am...
- a coder and visual designer, 
- a contributor to g0v’s 0archive project, which produces open datasets of web content, and
- a co-founder of g0v international taskforce, which facilitates international exchange for g0v projects and g0vers. 

I work with a small team of data engineers and researchers at IORG since 2019. We use scientific research to strengthen  information literacy of Taiwan’s public.

... working on using data science to identify narratives and trends of information manipulation, as well as propaganda spreading in Taiwan.

## 1 take-away
:::success
<span style="font-size: 1.5em">
Think information literacy before information warfare.
</span>
:::

## 4 proposals for researchers...
- We need open (& collaborative) data to study “Chinese disinformation” / “information warfare”
    - ... instead of closed-source data and intelligence
- We need scientific research & verifiable attribution
    - ... instead of unverified allegations
- Information spreads from multiple sources in a network, not a chain
    - ... and not always “from China”
- Separate content, behavior & intent
    - ... and develop different solutions for each

scientific research
Taiwan information literacy

Take away:
think information literacy before information warfare

strengthen civic society before “join the fight”

when we say “from China”, how certain are we?
phenomenon

research
information literacy

Dokidoki Alert
2021.Jun 
let people know what is going on 
narratives & trend
providing evidence and data analysis

Compiles “hot” fact-checking from TFC
and suspicious messages reported from Cofacts

https://iorg.tw/da
Full version in Taiwanese Mandarin
English: only summary... Sorry :(

actual data and actual evidence.
believe it is from China or not
editors choice: link to TFC
community

compile top topics on Cofacts

worth noting
mose prominent / potentially harmful narratives from the past couple of weeks are all about vaccines

table as a quick way to look and see what happened last week

last thing: labeling narratives
out of all kinds of “suspicious content”
at the center is “false content”
but information manipulation is much more than just false content
for example: unverified source / over-generalization

we need a common labeling system
this is a cross-org effort
create common language for information literacy

Kyri Q:
what's the disinformation 
valuable
mainstream media 
is there any those reports major publication read regualrily

none, relatively small and new organization
outreach for academic weekly reports
new to the weekly, 
data collection
need to write and archieve
lots work to 
do extra energy to let people know
discuss offline!
