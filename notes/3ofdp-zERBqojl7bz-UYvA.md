想請問Peter我們是否可能安排在7/22-7/26這個禮拜呢？

安排您的訪談在hackathon之後一週，
可以幫助我們熟悉您與vTaiwan的工作內容，
也能趁著您記憶猶新進行有關hackathon的提問。 

當日的訪談包含設備架設和訪談錄影以及建立鏡頭，
約需時3-4小時的時間，不過目前還未能確定確切日期，
不知道您是否有建議的日期，或是已經確認無法安排的日期呢？

有關20號hackathon的拍攝細節，
不知道我是否有可能在近兩週前往中研院的主場地拜訪，
了解更多有關場地和當天佈置的細節呢？

另外也請問vTaiwan平時是否也有習慣使用的實體場域呢？
希望能夠透過實際前往該場域拜訪您，除了和您說明我們拍攝的相關流程之外，
也希望藉此了解更多有關vTaiwan以及該場域的相關資訊，
近一步規劃評估如何建立vTaiwan團隊在hackathon活動以外的工作相關畫面。

About g0v and hackath0n

Tell us about g0v – its objectives; how it was originally a bimonthly hackathon; how it’s since expanded to include non-IT members; what it does now; and the binary symbolism of the 0 in g0v.

b.      Please tell us a little about the collaborative nature/culture of the community. 
c.       What does g0v’s philosophy mean? – “Ask not why nobody is doing this. You are the 'nobody'!"
Tell us about hackath0n – its objectives, its origins, its popularity and the efficacy of its projects.  
What are some applications that have arose out of the g0v movement, that remain popular today? E.g. Cofacts, Airmap, vTaiwan → Tell us about vTaiwan.

Dear Sir/Madam,
 
This is Zen writing from the documentary team at Channel News Asia (CNA). It's a pleasure to connect with you.
 
CNA was established by Mediacorp (Singapore’s national media network) and is an English-language Asian news channel.
 
We are producing a two-episode documentary series exploring the evolving nature of leadership and governance in today’s dynamic world, scheduled to premiere in the fourth quarter of 2024. Filming will be in August and September.
 
We've built a considerable portion of our documentary around figures from the 2023 civil society participation index. It is well known that Taiwan has extremely high rates of civil society participation, which shows up in this index.
 
The index aggregates a multitude of factors, including the extent to which the people of Taiwan are consulted by the state to address the needs of the country. One of the ways Taiwan is doing so, is through vTaiwan.
 
Hence, my team and I are quite keen to explore the possibility of featuring the vTaiwan in our documentary. May we schedule a virtual meeting with a representative next week to discuss the opportunity? I’m happy to send across a Microsoft Teams meeting link to facilitate the conversation.
 
Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. 
 
Warm regards

Hello, this is Zen sharing a quick meeting agenda ahead of our chat.

We will share more about the premise of our documentary with you to contextualise our request. 

After which, we would like to understand the projects that the vTaiwan community are currently working on. 

After which, my producer (Shahul) and I will attempt to propose a more specific filming plan for your consideration. 

Excited to meet you all soon.

Zen
