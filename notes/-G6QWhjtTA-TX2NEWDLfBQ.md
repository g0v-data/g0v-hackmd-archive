—The modern world is dominated by journalism and scientism, thus, truism(?) were to divided  in two: real and fake. Real has provisionally and chaotically developed in a   where normalization came into control. Or, scientism does not ease the realm of chaos.

Real is a provisional chaos in society where normalization came in control
developped in an society as

Scientism is overwhelmingly erratic, it is used on sovereignty totalitarianism,  it is used on capitalism, for each of their own political interest.

Journalism  is overwhelmingly erratic, it is used on propaganda, it is used on  commercializing, irrationalizing others for each and another political  interest.

As a citizen of capitalism, we were to divided in two, trustworthy and untrustworthy.（ref.）

(structural paragraph)this paragraph need to be an anchor(it was Laura who said this paragraph was meaningful)

Scientific research is to make people believe what they were informed, as well as  journalist try to make readers believe what they were informed. 

When scientific evidence was overly performed, we were made to believe, that it should be the ultimate realm of this chaotic world. 

# Hello World! 

The world, as we were brought in through productivity, is an ever-changing chaos. We weren’t able to know, we weren’t able to say, that a star bloom in the outer-space is not in motive of evolution.

Evolution begin when us human focus on intellectuality, it is the progression from human to humanoid. Evolution begin when biological human transforms it self, leaves behind their own conspiratorial origin, their own misinterpretation on God, Spirit. (Übermensch) 

Modern time scientists wouldn't find any experiment proven existence of Spirit and God, albeit our undeniable belief in supreme power. 

*(Mention: In the western philosophy corpus, there's a certain xenophobe and barbarism and paganism, thus God is a monometric in terms of western philosophy of religion.)*

服膺科學與新聞學的現代世界，真理的意義一分為二：真與假。現實社會中存有的混沌瞬息萬變，以致規訓。然而，科學並無法簡化混沌的處境。

經由當代科學研究得出的理論令人難以駁倒，此權威性卻構築在滿足極權專制政體以及資本主義市場的政治手段與政治利益。
經由新聞媒體傳播的消息報導令人難以消化，此傳播媒介使用於物化、商品化，模糊並混淆事實，動搖彼此各自的政治利益。

身處於資本主義自由市場的全球化公民，我們都是具有信託功能的產品。

科學研究者的佐證，令人們相信他們接收到的知識具有權威，媒體傳播者撰寫的報導，令讀者們相信他們得到的資訊具有公信。
