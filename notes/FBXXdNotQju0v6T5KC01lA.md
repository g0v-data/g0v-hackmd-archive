## Intro of the workshop
Civic tech empowers citizens worldwide to innovate tech projects for public participation, government transparency, environmental protection, and improved public services. But how to initiate a civic tech project, even a community? How to establish, sustain, and improve collaboration between civic tech communities, citizens, and the government? Furthermore, how to transfer the experience from civic tech communities into the promotion of digital citizenship education for the youth and citizens?

To answer these questions, this workshop will bring you the experience from g0v, the largest civic tech community in Taiwan, to have further discussion with a workshop kit designed by g0v jothon and g0v Civic Tech Project & Community Handbook
. In this workshop, you will learn how to:
1. Start your civic tech project/community with guidance.
2. Co-build the civic tech collaboration models within the community and government
3. Explore more possibilities to promote digital citizenship education 

Don't miss this opportunity to be part of a dynamic dialogue shaping the future of digital democracy and citizenship education. Your participation will contribute directly to the "[g0v Civic Tech Project & Community Handbook](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@jothon/ctpbook_en)," ensuring that your insights and experiences are shared with a global audience.

## Why Do We Hold this Workshop?
We use digital services provided by our governments every day; for example, tax filing systems, driving license applications, or flu or COVID-19 vaccination appointment systems. They make life convenient, but sometimes they could be badly designed and inaccessible to every citizen. In this scenario, citizens usually feel they are in a passive or disadvantageous position. The lack of technology expertise and opportunities to participate in the public procurement process to establish these public digital services deters citizens from using their voices to improve those services. 

In addition, when technologies, such as AI and Web 3, are fastly evolving and bring both positive and negative impacts to everyone, young people or even general citizens will need a new digital citizenship education that can empower them to harness these technologies. Such education should enable young people to use technologies to create digital solutions to problems in their lives and for social good and to understand and prevent the risks behind these technologies, such as cyber security, data protection, bias and malicious use of generative AI, addiction to social media, etc.

In order to tackle these problems with citizens, we are going to hold this workshop by sharing g0v, Taiwan‚Äôs biggest civic tech communities, and g0v Sch001‚Äôs successful practices with you. 

Founded in 2012, g0v gathers people with technology expertise and people without technology background but with a strong commitment to democracy, freedom, human rights, environmental protection, and social good to co-build many successful digital solutions and collaborations with Taiwan‚Äôs government. vTaiwan, the digital participation platform for deliberation of technology laws and digital mask-map during the outbreak of COVID-19 are encouraging examples to show citizens and governments can work together to optimize the quality of public services and approaches for people‚Äôs participation. The ‚ÄúThaubing Footprint environmental data visualization website,‚Äù initiated by the Green Citizens‚Äô Action Alliance (GCAA)  and Disfactory Project, also featured by FNF Global Innovation Hub‚Äôs Innovation for Democracy Cafe, are examples of how civil society can actively make use of technology for their advocacy by collaborating civic tech communities such as g0v.

In addition, g0v also initiated [g0v Sch001](https://sch001.g0v.tw/), a borderless and free online ‚Äúschool‚Äù offering students digital citizenship education that may not exist in normal high schools since 2019. The g0v Sch001 has initiated around 65 courses to teach students to learn what is AI, Web 3, NTF, DAO, and all kinds of emerging technology. Students will learn these technologies not only from the technical aspects but also from the aspects of democracy, privacy, human rights, project management, and collaboration because g0v Sch001‚Äôs goal is to establish a comprehensive digital citizenship literacy education for students. Finally, students will not just passively listen to lectures, they will be invited to propose their civic tech projects for social good, and g0v will offer its professional members as mentors to incubate their projects. 

## What Can this Worksop Offer Me? 
You will be the first one in the European Continent to learn, use, operate, and contribute your ideas to g0v‚Äôs g0v Civic Tech Project & Community Handbook. The handbook not only records the experience of how g0v established its own community, all kinds of successful civic tech projects, and its models for collaborations with governments or civil society members. Furthermore, the handbook turned those experiences into operable and useful kits and checkboxes that everyone can use to guide themselves to establish their civic tech communities, civic tech projects, or collaborations with governments. 

Also, founders and contributors of g0v Sch001 will come to the workshop to share their experiences and lead the discussion on what kind of new visions and contents of digital citizenship education we should provide to the youth and citizens. They also designed a new workshop kit for this workshop, and hope that you can offer your feedback to help them to improve the kit and make it globally and sustainably usable. 

To sum up, Ms Iabel Hou, former chairperson of g0v jothon and one of the founders of g0v Sch001, and Ms Tiff Lin, contributor of g0v Sch001, will lead you and all the participants to learn how to:
1. Start your civic tech project/community with guidance.
2. Co-build the civic tech collaboration models within the community and government
3. Explore more possibilities to promote digital citizenship education

## What Do I Need to Do in this Workshop?
Your participation and feedback will be a very important basis for g0v jothon and Sch001 to improve their g0v Civic Tech Project & Community Handbook and their new strategies for developing digital citizenship education. Until now, the Handbook only collects the experience and feedback from participants in Taiwan and Asia, and g0v jothon really hopes that they can collect the perspectives, experiences, and feedback on civic tech and digital citizenship education from European participants. Your feedback or any contribution of opinions and ideas will be anonymously collected, summarized, verified, and edited, and thus become the basis of new content to improve the Handbook and make it more usable in a global context. 


## Who Should Participate?
Anyone who wants to know how to make digital public services more participatory and transparent to the citizens, how citizens can use technology to create digital solutions for problems in society, democracy, freedom, and human rights, and who wants to enhance digital citizenship education for the youth and general citizens to help them navigate this era with fast-evolving technology development, please feel free to register.
