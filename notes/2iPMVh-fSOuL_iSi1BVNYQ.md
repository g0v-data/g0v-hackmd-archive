What is a Familiarization Visit?
A familiarization visit, also known as a FAM visit, allows travel influencers, bloggers, journalists, and tour operators to explore and experience a destination firsthand. These visits are typically offered for free or at a discounted rate. FAM visits serve as a way for destination managers to showcase their tourism offerings and promote their destination.

As a relatively less-known destination with a unique language, Vietnam has strategically utilized familiarization trips to share the country's natural beauty and cultural diversity with the world. In recent years, familiarization visits have significantly contributed to expanding tourism to new markets such as India, Malaysia, the Philippines, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
For example, a FAM trip organized by the Da Nang Department of Tourism brought travel influencers and travel agency representatives from the Philippines to experience Da Nang's services and attractions. This visit effectively promoted Da Nang to the Philippine tourism community.
