Is Your Virgo Horoscope for Money Looking Good This Week?

Okay, so I know the title sounds a bit out there, right? Like, a serious tech guy looking at horoscopes for money advice? Hear me out, though. It’s less about believing the stars and more about finding a weird pattern in my workflow and trying to see if I could game it, maybe even just for a laugh, and document the whole mess.

The Starting Line: A Strange Habit
My work life is pretty structured. I handle a lot of freelance consulting, mainly deployment automation and some backend stuff. I noticed a really bizarre trend: my highest-earning weeks often coincided with weeks where my Virgo money horoscope, as written by this one specific online portal I sometimes checked for entertainment, was vaguely optimistic. I’m talking about maybe three out of four times it actually tracked. It was probably confirmation bias, but it got me thinking. Could I use this as an external trigger to either push harder or pull back?

I decided to run a little, completely unscientific experiment for a couple of months. I would track my actual weekly revenue against what this specific horoscope predicted for “money or career” for Virgos that week.
