Prosecutors usually do not prosecute bureaucrats. Litigations are in two parts, one being the civil liability and apology for the injured, and the other being criminal liability; for example, did the police abuse their power? The usage of police batons violated the principle of proportionality. The removal of people should not require the equipment of police batons, and the removal would be much more efficient without the weight of the batons. (2) Civil disobedience is an entitled right. The criminal code will examine whether the behaviors have caused any damages, judging the legality of the incident. One of my teachers has said that when the behaviors of the state convince the people that its executive actions cannot be altered, and mechanisms within the institution become so dysfunctional that the people have no choice but to seek alternatives outside the institution, the legality of the students' actions must be discussed at the constitutional level. (3) Unconstitutional laws are null and void. International Covenant only reflects values, because conditions are different in every country, but the Covenant provides these differen countries the common values of human being, and that is what is most important in law. Assembly and Parade Act should be unconstitutional, but it could be used to provide grounds for separation and prevention of conflict; however, the government chose to implement the total prohibition. The choice of conceptual value is the main problem. Our executive branch is too powerful, so our representatives are unable to express their own opinions. The judiciary is weak, which needs the reinforcement of the citizens."],["",""],["20","32 (Jinan) \\[lawyer\\]  The prosecutors is controlled by the administrative power and need to consider the opinions from the higher hierarchy. When the prosecutor applied for the detention of Wei Yang, it raised many objections from the field of law. The Legislative Yuan is a place where the congress has autonomy. Its leader, Mr. Wang Jin-pyng has the power to disperse protesters, but he didn’t do that. We should discuss the occupy of Executive Yuan in 3 aspects. (1) It is illegal, depending on which law. (2) There is a grey area between the building of Executive Yuan and its front door. It is like the debate of whether someone’s front yard is part of his residence area. The sidewalk is for the pedestrians, however, the biggest conflict (between people and police) happened on the Beiping Rd. I think this is problematic. Spontaneous rallies and marches are the right for people, according to the justices of the Constitutional Court. So there is room for discussion. (3)The laws do not explain the meaning and concepts underneath. If the justices cannot tell us the underlying values or principles that laws should protect, their judgment is superficial. A country under the rule of law highly evaluates due processes. That is why it is so hard for us to accept that congress member Mr. Chang used 30 seconds to pass such important agreement. (The justices) did not explain this underlying value that we respect and try to protect."],["",""],["20","12 (Jinan) \\[Professor from NTU\\] Contrary to the law, the function of media is to make complex stuff easier to understand. Social movement has three frames in the mainstream media. First, the mainstream media tends to ignore us. For example, the Dapu Incident was known through citizen journalism. When there was a stronger media channel that couldn’t be ignored anymore, the mainstream media joined in. Conflicts are typical frames of social movement. They are characterized by the action of blaming, which is called stigmatization. Stigmatizing the legitimacy of a movement or partisanize the movement cause the movement lose its legitimacy and purity. (Another characteristics is) using tabloid to entertain, just as the reports of sun cakes and bananas, and use highly entertaining way to report this movement. Media is influenced by their attitude toward the movement leaders, by the market, and by their information resources. For example, journalists that tend to receive information from political party members, or those that have follow social movement for a long time, have different understanding of social movements. We should compare the reports from different media to make a judgment close to the reality.  The second frame of social movement in media is based on the structure of media. (We should identify) who their bosses are, and understand the structure of media. The third frame is the new media. The current media environment differs a lot from the past. Internet discussion through high technology makes everyone of you a type of media. (You should) use Facebook to broadcast what you see, to fight against the frame that media imposes on social movement."],["",""],["19","49 (Jinan) \\[teacher Chen\\] In 1948 UN reached the consensus that “people own the right gather news. Every citizen can do newsgathering. The right to newsgathering is not only for the mainstream media, but for all citizens.” The power in the democracy countries comes from election and exams. We give freedom to the mainstream media by exempting their journalists from elections and exams. If media function fully to their responsibility, they will win our respect and money. For the past decades, only financial groups and political parties can create mainstream media. When the internet appear, mainstream media is in the process of breaking down. The founders of mainstream media are basically financial groups, the same in commercials. Political financial groups now control mainstream media. The CCSTA gives profitable opportunities for these financial groups, so that mainstream media becomes the media for these rich people. Mainstream media becomes farther and farther from people, they also go against their original obligation. It is the era for us to get our own media!

Today this is finally a hall that belongs to the people, so thank you all, thank you! (applause) Historically this is a key moment in Taiwan's history. Over the past 100 years Taiwan's history has been a ...(indistinguishable) history, and we want and need a society with freedom and dignity. We want self-determination, we want human rights. This desire continued for over 100 years but it was difficult, because our government has always been from the outside, colonial. It was until the 80-90s, especially the wild lily movement 24 years ago, the external form of a democracy was built. Martial law ended in 1991, but people received freedom of speech only in 97, and the \"black list\" ended. This means a democracy in form was only established between the 90s to... (indistinguishable). But there it remained, without progress. These past oligarchs put on the mask of democracy and now act as despots. So from a historical perspective we are now at the crux. If we submit, if we fail, we may lose even this democracy in form that we have, and we will go back to despotism. If we persevere and win Taiwan will be renewed and we will again move towards a real democracy, and the people will again be the rightful owners of this country. This key battle is happening today, here, among you. Of course there are other benefits as well. We can see that the occupation of Parliament has received broad support. You are not alone.

Which means that all roads and boulevards near any government buildings are considered illegal ground to protest on. One would then be forced to protest at places no where to be seen by the public and media. In particular, all protesting activities on the Kai Boulevard (The one in front of president Ma's office) is illegal. Even though, a lot of lawyers have asked the grand jury (explains the constitution of Taiwan) about this particular law. They waited for 5 years before telling the public that the gathering and protesting law is actually against our constitution. However, if one examines closely, one will notice that they purposely skipped the lines where the prohibited locations are defined and where the consequences are listed in the constitution. The grand jury chose the most irrelevant passage for the explanation (#318) Now, if the police are arresting every single people who have participated this event over the last few days, that would halt our judicial system for a extended period of time. The grand jury immediately realized that the statement they made was bizarre. So they made another statement about the constitution on the following day. Not only have they addressed the flaw in the previous statement, they also eliminated the gray area in that particular portion of the constitution by stating that all other statements made comply with the constitution.

So I think we are legal. They should revise it, because it concerns our national policy. After more than 4k hours of deliberations Holland decided to return to the ocean what belonged to the ocean. Things like flood control, rezoning and many complex policy issues, they plan to gradually change national policy over the next 100 years in response to climate change. As for the ECFA, we should actively participate. That day at Lugang there were many cross-industry experts and I thought the meeting was meaningful. This change in basic national policy should be considered with the level of care they took in Holland. Right now the government doesn't feel it is obligated to communicate with its citizens, for example regarding the risks of industries covered in the CSSTA being overwhelmed by Chinese capital in the boardroom, or whether we might be surrounded by Chinese internet hackers, but I don't see them discussing that. Right now our problem is a lack of trust; even though parts of a policy might need to be kept confidential the policy as a whole must be publicly debatable.

The CSSTA deals with the flow of people, goods, and the economy. But as soon as immigration is involved, you need to think of the scope and types of people and cultures. Now at Tunghai University, everyone knows that they are fighting back against the development projects, hotels opening on Xiang mountain are known about, and behind them is investment from Hong Kong. The same investors that helped support Ma during the elections. There are only 700 members left in the Thao aboriginal tribe, but the hotel on Xiang mountain will hold 3,000 people when it’s full. They only take foreign guests, directly to Alishan. These 3,000 people will affect not only the environment around Sun Moon Lake, but also the ethnic communities of the Pingpu tribes. There are 14 tribes, but many Pingpu people are demanding that their proper identity be restored. There are 45 types of ethnic languages, we also have Hakkanese, Heluonese, and post-war immigrants. Our culture is pluralistic, and even though it is pluralistic the scope is small. There are about 500,000 aboriginals, making up only 2% of the population. And we don’t hear their voices clearly. Consider the scope of what they face in the voices of the Taiwanese, is it easy to be understood? And looking at this, the small size of the ethnic communities that will not be protected by the CSSTA, makes you think. Opening these tourist areas, despite bringing in money, but if the owners are Chinese, we who are members of these small communities will be the object of tourism. If you were taken by a tour guide, how would you understood Sun Moon Lake, Alishan, the treasures of Taiwan? This is concerning. Things that a country should naturall"],["y do become business capital. The old people of the Buluo tribe had a culture of mutual support, but it has been commercialized and seriously attacked. And construction has started, many public works projects have been brought up. We have Taiwan’s precious forest natural resources, and aboriginal communities are easily affected. Opening the agricultural markets, aboriginal agricultural products are all different. Small-grained rice is a sacred aboriginal crop, this kind of livelihood is simply different from the norm. No matter what, Taiwan’s multiculturalism is the foundation of our democracy, please make a careful consideration.

(Prof. Cheng from Hong Kong Poly U Applied Sociology Department) There is a saying in Hong Kong, that it needs mainland China to maintain its GDP growth. However, the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, and over one million people are living in poverty. Hong Kong's wealth disparity is the most serious among all other countries, but we didn't riot. As students, teachers and teens in Taiwan protest against the CSSTA, some people there claim that the action is anti-globalization. They believe that if Taiwan does not sign this treaty with mainland China it will be marginalized, and the unemployment rate will soar. However,  I believe to be against the CSSTA is to be for democratic action and equal rights, because globalization is an economic condition of Neoliberalism. 1. Most industries in mainland China are monopolized by major corporations, but there is an appearance of parity between China and Taiwan. For example there is a major dentist chain in China which dominates a part of China's dental service. Dental service in Taiwan however is usually run by individuals. The market in mainland China is a near monopoly, RMB is not freely exchangeable all over the world, meaning it's a monopolized commodity. Mainland China has been depriving the working class of benefits and exporting their commodities by taking advantage of its low costs, all while claiming that they prefer and love freedom. This is their \"party-state capitalism\", or raw capitalism. This is not the American-style capitalism we are used to, this is all-consuming. Chinese capital is all-consuming, whether you be large or small. If this sort of capitalism enters the local economy, everything inside the local economy will be consumed. For example, food stands in HK have all but disappeared, and replaced by jewelry stores, because they no longer need to provide a local service to be profitable, they can provide services to foreigners."],["Also because of the large number of new immigrants from mainland China has diluted the democratic electorate base, now less than 1/3 of HK's population prefers democracy. 1. They no longer have the right to choose the head of the HKSAR, and their legislators are not all popularly elected, but some are selected from industry representatives. The CSSTA is not neoliberalism, it's a crony of the communist party.

If I am just a normal person without property, how am I supposed to purchase a house, to have a roof over my head? Not to mention those who are burdened with student loans. Once the sudden influx of foreign investment comes in, what will happen to our industries? Some declining industries nowadays have taken slow steps in transforming themselves. When foreign investment forcefully comes in, can we Taiwanese people handle it? Take my uncle as an example, he used to be in the crayon business for Lionart (雄獅), Chinese people wanted to pressure him with crushing capital, but he persevered. But if it's happening here in Taiwan, should we all hang in there like he did? Next, let's talk about democracy.
