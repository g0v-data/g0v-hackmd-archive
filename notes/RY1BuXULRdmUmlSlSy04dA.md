My cousin mentioned he sometimes sells CS2 skins he doesn't use anymore and makes a few bucks. Got me wondering if that's something worth looking into. Found https://qnnit.com/how-can-i-make-money-through-the-csgo-marketplace/ while searching around and it explains how the whole thing works. Seems like you need to know what's popular and when to buy or sell. Might try it with a cheap skin just to see how it goes but not expecting to make serious money or anything. Just curious if it's actually doable for regular players
