Taiwan, a democratic country who elects its own president and congress, is currently under intensive debate on whether to legally recognize same-sex marriage, and has received attention of international media including The Economist and New York Times, and \[各國自己媒體\]. The legislative process, i.e. the amendment of the Taiwanese Civil Code, which had previously obtained cross-party support and the support of the majority of the citizens according to a poll done in 2013, is now under strong pressure from not only pro-LGBT activists, but also conservative religious groups. On December third, some 100,000 people rallied on Ketagalan Blvd. in Taipei, Taiwan, protesting against the legislation, and demanding the preservation of "traditional values". In response, pro-LGBT groups in Taiwan is organizing an assembly to support the legislation on December 10th, the Human Rights Day, on Ketagalan Blvd., in the belief that the pursuit of equal rights to marry for homosexual align with the core values of the Human Rights Day.

The assembly on Human Rights Day in Taiwan will be echoed world-wide in the same weekend in 28 different cities in the US, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, UK, Switzerland, Norway, Japan, Australia, and Thailand. In \[城市名\], the rally will begin at \[詳細地點\], where \[歷史上特殊的某件事\] occurred. \[詳細活動細節\] \[某某當地組織\] will also participate to support our cause.

The assembly taking place in \[城市名\], as well as the other 27 occuring this weekend world-wide, are parts of the global campaign initiated from a press conference in Washington D.C. on 11/30, which had since obtained world-wide support from Taiwanese organizers and Overseas Taiwanese for Democracy, a Taiwanese activist group.

We sincerely invite you to our rally, and look forward to seeing you.
