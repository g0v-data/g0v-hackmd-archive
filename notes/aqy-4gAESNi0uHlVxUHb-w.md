### Chapter 1: About the g0v Community
## What is g0v?

![](https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/g0v-hackmd-images/uploads/upload_9b1d2406907b825672598253004765ec.png =500x)


### What is g0v?

g0v is a grassroots social movement that aims to deepen civic engagements and connections between society and citizens. You can find like-minded partners in the g0v community, achieve your ideas in a grassroots approach, and then release the results under an open-source license, letting people build upon your foundations.

g0v replaces "o" in gov with "0", which reimagines the role of government from scratch zero and reflects the vision from 0 to 1 of the digital natives.

#### How g0v Works?

g0v's promotion uses both online and offline approaches. It utilizes various internet tools and hosts a hackathon every two months. Participants propose different projects and look for volunteers. Oftentimes, in addition to main hackathons, project teams will hold their own meetups and hackathons separately. This approach encourages grassroots idea realization, fostering active engagement rather than a passive one.

#### Participants of g0v

Participants of g0v can engage in the community both online and offline. The only requirement for our participants is to believe in open collaboration. Participants come from all fields and not necessarily from engineer background. Though most members in the early days of g0v were software engineers, now over 60% of participants in the g0v community do not have a technical background. We have participants from various fields such as design, legal profession, social activism, writing, and others.

Is it a problem if participant can’t write code? **Not at all!**

#### Project
The g0v community's projects are diverse. Since 2012, it has submitted over 900 proposals in more than 50 hackathons. Themes include open government, government supervision, environmental protection, misinformation, housing policies, language preservation, experimental education, and emerging ones like Web 3 and AI. These interdisciplinary projects are initiated autonomously by g0v participants.

Regarding the civic projects in g0v, the community encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration and focuses on current social issues, which builds an essential foundation that unites g0v participants.

### g0v Manifesto

Initially drafted by Ipa, finalized by community consensus, and revised by community discussion at any time. The g0v Manifesto clearly defines the spirit of g0v, the central idea of collaboration and openness, and it is metaphorically the "constitution" of the g0v.

#### We come from everywhere

g0v is a community of open collaboration. Contributors are from everywhere. We are software developers, designers, activists, educators, writers, citizens, and netizens of every profession. We gather in the hope of improving Taiwan’s civil society through technology and collaboration. If you’re willing to contribute your skills and expertise, you can take part in g0v.

#### We are a polycentric community of self-organized contributors

g0v projects are self-initiated and self-organized. With this Manifesto as the base of consensus, every g0v project makes its own decisions on its operation and governance. The g0v community is made up of these self-governing projects. There is no specific representative of g0v.

#### We are citizens collaborating to bring about change

Starting from the open-source movement, g0v is an active citizen of Taiwan. We the g0v contributors support freedom of speech and information transparency. By providing digestible information and hands-on digital tools, contributors bring more citizens to participate in public issues and influence government actions.

#### We live open-source

g0v contributors communicate and collaborate online, gather and connect in hackathons offline. Project outcomes (including but not limited to text, images, code, data, analysis, and processes) are open-source, allowing more people to use, improve, comment, and maximize their usage.

#### We have fun and want to change the status quo

We the g0v contributors love to dig into problems, and we take pleasure in finding solutions and taking action to make a change. We connect different expertise to amplify our collective force. Guided by imagination, we collaborate and explore new frontiers. We act to change the status quo. We refuse to stay in silence.

#### We are you

g0v is a non-partisan, not-for-profit, grassroots movement. You can contribute to projects with your intelligence or your physical force. You can also be a sponsor for g0v hackathons or specific projects. If you like what is mentioned above, get involved with g0v. Share your project ideas and your aspiration about a world renewed. Join us to change our society for the better.
