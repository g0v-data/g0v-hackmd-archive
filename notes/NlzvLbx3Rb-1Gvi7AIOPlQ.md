# Battle of the Protocols: HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3
The digital environment we live in today has been greatly influenced by the development of web protocols. The most notable developments are HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3, which each mark a turning point in the effort to achieve faster, more effective, and more secure web communication.

We travel through the "Battle of the Protocols" in this article, contrasting HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 to learn about their strengths and limitations. We examine the development of web protocols and their influence on the contemporary internet user experience, starting with the fundamental ideas of HTTP/1.1 and moving on to the ground-breaking inventions of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

## Frequently Asked Questions about HTTP Protocol
Before we go further to dissect the different HTTP protocols, let's provide answers to some of the fundamental and frequently asked questions about HTTP protocol.

Here are some frequently asked questions about the HTTP protocol:

### What is a Protocol?
A protocol is a collection of guidelines that control the flow of data back and forth between systems or devices. It makes it possible for efficient communication across networks by defining the format, organization, and flow of messages that are exchanged.

The purpose and intricacy of protocols differ, ranging from basic email protocols to intricate web browsing protocols. In the end, protocols serve as the cornerstone of contemporary digital communication, enabling smooth online engagement.

### What is HTTP?
Hypertext Transfer Protocol is referred to as [HTTP](https://httpwg.org/specs/). It is an application layer protocol that is used to send hypermedia documents across the Internet, such as HTML files.

### How does HTTP work?
HTTP works on a client-server architecture, in which web browsers and other clients send requests for resources to servers, who then provide the desired data. The stateless exchange of requests and answers makes each transaction independent of earlier exchanges.

### What are the different methods in HTTP?
The action to be taken on a resource is specified by one of the several verbs, or methods, defined by HTTP. GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), DELETE (delete data), and other methods are frequently used.

### What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
A secure variant of HTTP, known as [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), encrypts data while it is transferred between clients and servers. For secure communication, including online banking and e-commerce, HTTPS is frequently utilized.

### What is the role of headers in HTTP?
Additional data transmitted with HTTP requests and responses are known as HTTP headers. Headers include information about the request or response's metadata, including the type of content, encoding, cookies, and caching instructions.

### What is the significance of HTTP status codes?
The success or failure of an HTTP request is indicated by HTTP status codes. Typical [status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) that indicate the result of the request are 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and others.

### How does HTTP caching work?
Clients can locally store copies of web resources to lower server load and latency thanks to HTTP caching. The length of time a resource can be cached and the circumstances under which it needs to be revalidated with the server are indicated by caching directives in HTTP headers.

## Overview of Different Versions of HTTP
Examining the various Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  versions is crucial to comprehending the development of web communication technologies. Improvements in web interaction security, efficiency, and performance have been the focus of every HTTP version. We'll give a summary of the main improvements and functionality added to HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 versions in this section. 

We can learn more about the ongoing development of web technologies and their influence on the contemporary digital environment by looking at these protocols.

### HTTP/1 : The Foundation
Operating over [Transmission Control Protocol](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/TCP-IP) (TCP), HTTP/1 was a major milestone in the development of web protocols, published in 1996. Because it relied on distinct TCP connections for every request, it was inefficient and resulted in higher latency and worse performance, particularly as web pages became more complicated. 

The restricted amount of concurrent connections per server led to scalability problems. Afterward, HTTP was redesigned with the introduction of HTTP/1.1 to get around these restrictions.

**Remark:** The comparison does not include HTTP/1 because it was an older version with built-in constraints, mostly related to resource consumption, scalability, and performance, all of which were greatly improved upon and addressed in HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.

### HTTP/1.1: The Evolution
In 1997, HTTP/1.1 quickly followed. By eliminating the need to create new TCP connections for every request, it introduced the "keep alive" feature, which reduces latency by enabling connections to be reused for many requests. But another aspect of HTTP/1.1, HTTP pipelining, caused problems with head-of-line blocking. 

Although pipelining potentially speeds up communication by enabling many requests to be sent without waiting for each response, performance is decreased overall when there is a delay or obstruction in one request because it impacts subsequent requests on the same connection. To lessen the impact of delays on individual requests, modern web browsers use numerous simultaneous TCP connections to the same server. Requests can now be sent concurrently thanks to this. This method improves web page loading speed by striking a compromise between the necessity for parallelism and the complexity and overhead of handling multiple connections.

Here are the key features, strengths, and limitations of HTTP/1.1:

**Features:**

* HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over the same connection, reducing overhead. Additionally, the Host header enables virtual hosting, serving multiple websites on a single server. Chunked Transfer-Encoding supports transferring data in pieces, beneficial for streaming or transferring large files with unknown durations.

**Strengths:**

* HTTP/1.1 brought significant advancements, including persistent connections for reduced overhead, the Host header enabling virtual hosting, and Chunked Transfer-Encoding for flexible data transfer. Its strengths lie in backward compatibility, persistent connections reducing latency, and widespread support among web servers, clients, and proxies.

**Limitations:**

* HTTP/1.1 suffers from head-of-line blocking, limited multiplexing capabilities, and security vulnerabilities due to the lack of internal authentication and encryption, making communications susceptible to manipulation and interception.

### HTTP/2: The Transition
When HTTP/2 was released in 2015, it addressed the shortcomings of HTTP/1.1 and added new functionality, which made it a major improvement over HTTP/1.1. It improved network resource use by introducing HTTP streams, which allowed numerous requests and responses to be multiplexed over a single TCP connection. Because HTTP/2 streams are independent, as opposed to HTTP/1.1 pipelining, head-of-line blocking is eliminated, improving performance and lowering latency. 

Furthermore, HTTP/2 added server push functionality, which enables servers to forward resources to clients in advance, improving performance and cutting down on page load times. In general, HTTP/2 prioritizes performance, reduced latency, and improved user experience, making it a more reliable and efficient protocol for contemporary web applications.


HTTP/2 brought significant improvements over HTTP/1.1 by addressing its limitations and introducing new features. Here are the key features, strengths, and limitations of HTTP/2:

**Features:**

* HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing for efficient resource utilization, header compression to reduce overhead, server push to proactively deliver resources, and stream prioritization for better resource allocation and improved user experience.

**Strengths:**

* HTTP/2 offers improved performance through multiplexing, header compression, and server push, while maintaining backward compatibility with HTTP/1.1 for seamless transitions and efficient resource utilization by reducing connection overhead.

**Limitations:**

* HTTP/2 introduces complexities in implementation, particularly with multiplexed streams, stream prioritization, and server push, potentially leading to challenges for administrators and developers. Additionally, its dependency on Transport Layer Security (TLS) for widespread adoption can impact performance, and despite attempts to address head-of-line blocking, it can still occur in certain scenarios, especially with shared connections and lagging streams.

### HTTP/3: The Revolution
After debuting as a draft in 2020, HTTP/3 is a significant advancement in web protocols since it replaces the conventional TCP transport protocol with [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114) (Quick UDP Internet Connections). 

By allowing many streams to share a connection without requiring extra handshakes, QUIC emphasizes stream multiplexing and maximizes resource use. Most importantly, it ensures independent stream delivery even in the event of packet loss or congestion, hence eliminating head-of-line blocking at the transport layer improving performance and lowering latency. 

Moreover, QUIC's usage of Connection ID facilitates smooth switching between IP addresses and network interfaces, which is very helpful for users who are on the go. HTTP/3, driven by QUIC, is gaining momentum despite its recent inception because it prioritizes performance, dependability, and adaptability to meet the demands of the current internet.

Here are the key features, strengths, and limitations of HTTP/3:

**Features:**

* The QUIC protocol, underlying HTTP/3, offers more efficient multiplexing and lower latency by treating streams as first-class citizens, enhancing reliability with integrated error correction and congestion control, and enabling quicker connection establishment without the standard TCP handshake procedure.

**Strengths:**

* HTTP/3, powered by QUIC, offers reduced latency and improved performance on mobile networks through independent streams and rapid connection establishment, enhancing user experience. Its flexibility and adaptability make it suitable for various network environments and use cases, including streaming, real-time communication, and web browsing.

**Limitations:**

* HTTP/3's limitations stem from its dependency on UDP, which may face restrictions or blocking by some networks, potentially limiting its accessibility and adoption.

All things considered, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 provide considerable gains over HTTP/1.1 in terms of speed, efficiency, and lower latency; the addition of QUIC to HTTP/3 brings even more advantages. Each version, however, has advantages and disadvantages of its own, and the choice of protocol is influenced by several variables, including performance objectives, compatibility requirements, and the particular requirements of the website or application.

##  Real-world examples illustrating performance differences between Protocols
Numerous websites and web apps provide real-world examples of how HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 function differently. Here are a few typical situations:

* Website Loading Speed: HTTP/1.1 websites load resources sequentially over distinct TCP connections, leading to increased latency, especially over distant servers or unreliable networks. In contrast, HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing to retrieve multiple resources simultaneously over a single TCP connection, significantly reducing load times for complex websites. HTTP/3, powered by QUIC, further minimizes latency by eliminating head-of-line blocking and improving congestion management, resulting in faster loading times, particularly on cellular networks or in high packet loss scenarios.

* Streaming and Real-Time Communication: Because HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offer server push and multiplexing, streaming services—like video and music platforms—can benefit from improved performance. This makes it possible to distribute media content more effectively, which leads to buffering reduction and smoother playback. Based on QUIC, HTTP/3 offers reduced latency, which is advantageous for real-time communication applications like chat rooms and multiplayer games. This improves the user experience by enabling faster response times and data delivery.

* Mobile Web Browsing: Issues like excessive network latency and restricted bandwidth are common for mobile users. Header compression and connection multiplexing are two mobile-specific enhancements provided by HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 that can enhance performance and cut down on data consumption. Furthermore, HTTP/3's usage of QUIC can be especially helpful for mobile users who regularly switch between networks (such as cellular and Wi-Fi), as it allows for more dependable transmission over erratic connections and faster connection creation.

* E-commerce and Transactional Websites: For e-commerce websites and other transactional platforms to guarantee a seamless user experience, clients and servers need to communicate quickly and reliably. Faster checkout speeds and higher conversion rates can be achieved by optimizing the distribution of product pictures, payment processing, and other dynamic content using HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

Overall, users will likely have a better overall web browsing experience with HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 because of the newer protocols' substantial increases in speed, efficiency, and dependability, even though the performance differences between them may vary based on particular use cases and network conditions.

## Examples of websites that use HTTP/1.1, 2 and 3
However, it can be difficult to pinpoint particular websites that only use HTTP/1, HTTP/2, or HTTP/3 because many websites support multiple protocols at once or switch between protocols depending on many factors like server capabilities, network conditions, and browser support. Nonetheless, the following websites are instances of those who have tried or implemented these protocols:

1. **HTTP/1:** It's possible that a large number of older or less updated websites still primarily utilize HTTP/1, particularly if they haven't been updated for newer protocols. Smaller blogs, individual webpages, or older services that still use HTTP/1 are not uncommon.

2. **HTTP/2:** To make use of HTTP/2's multiplexing, header compression, and server push features, large-scale websites and platforms that place a high priority on performance and user experience frequently implement it. A few websites that use HTTP/2 are  [Google](https://www.google.com.ng/) (including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Search), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/?lang=en), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) and [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/).

3. **HTTP/3:** Based on the QUIC protocol, HTTP/3 is a relatively modern technology that may still be being adopted by large websites. Nonetheless, a few businesses and services have started testing HTTP/3 in live settings. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/),  [Google](https://www.google.com.ng/) and [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) are a few examples.
