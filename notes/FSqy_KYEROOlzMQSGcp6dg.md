Been collecting CS2 skins for around six months now and it's become a side hobby alongside playing. Started by selling all my cheap drops and saving up for one decent AK skin I actually liked. Now I have skins for most weapons I use regularly. What I learned from https://dmarket.com/cs2-wiki/ is that some skins look expensive but are actually affordable while others that seem basic cost a fortune because they're rare. Wear condition matters a lot - factory new and minimal wear usually look similar but have big price gaps. I avoid battle scarred skins because they look too scratched up in game. Just buy skins you'll actually enjoy looking at instead of treating everything like an investment
