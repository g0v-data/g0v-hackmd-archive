based on previous talk: [https://speakerdeck.com/clkao/open-source-open-data-open-government](https://speakerdeck.com/clkao/open-source-open-data-open-government)

### Session title:  If Data == 'open'



Talk title: Open Source, Open Data, Open Government (suggestions??)
> DIY Open Government
> [name=Chia-liang K]


Opening:
- Icelandic constitution, Finnish experiment
- back to Asia, the power-up commercial
- self-intro (with budget)
Open Source:
- modern collaboration model without central coordination
- similarly, with open culture: wikipedia, openstreetmap
Open Data:
- government possesses lots of data. opening is just transparency.
- participation is only possible after transparency
- congress example
- environment dashboard example
g0v:
- gov -> g0v, we are not here to change government websites, we are here to change the government
- how hackathon works, how collaboration works like open source
- stats, think tank => do tank
Closing:
- rough consensus and running code
- build your own g0v, it's all open source
- make a difference
