# How to Add Fireworks Effect to your React App

This React app guide will teach you how to integrate fireworks effects into it. We will start by explaining how to set up a new React project. And then we will learn how to incorporate a firework effect library and customize it to make user engagement more captivating and interactive.

Add fireworks to your web applications to celebrate special events, and interactive games and enhance your user interface with excitement. After reading this guide, you have sufficient knowledge and skills that can make you able to implement and customize them on your React projects.

## Prerequisites
Before you learn to use Firework Effects in a React app, you must understand React and JS basics. To go through this lesson about building and customizing components, one should be aware of React components, state management, and props. Moreover, it would be helpful if you knew how to code in new JavaScript standards (ES6+) so that it would be easy for you to understand examples and changes made throughout the text.

Establishing a React development environment is another essential requirement; it means that Node.js and npm(Node Package Manager) should be in the machine as well. While these are basic tools used to manage dependencies and work with React apps generally, installing Node.js (that also brings npm as a bonus) offered on their website would be necessary if not done already.

After installing Node.js and npm, you will need to configure your React environment by working with Create React App for beginning development. Set up a new React project that follows some common structure and lets you build customer modules It simplifies the initial setup process, allowing you to focus on building your application without worrying about configuration details.

Once you have a basic knowledge of React and JavaScript, as well as an appropriate development environment, you will be ready to follow this guide to successfully integrate firework effects to React application.

## Setting Up the React Project
In the section, your reading will guide you through the initial phases of setting up a React project with fireworks that will be eventually integrated. These involve creating a new React application through the Create React App method as well as installing packages that are required .

We will begin with Create React App, a commonly used tool, it helps to establish new React projects in a standardized manner by providing structure and configuration that are standard, thereby easing setup at the start. Go ahead, and follow these steps.

### Running `npx create-react-app firework-app`
Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app firework-app
```
If you run this command line, you can start your React project in the `firework-app` folder straight away. It is possible because `npx` is bundled with `npm` starting from version 5.2 and so it enables you to execute commands without having them installed globally on your machine.

### Navigating to the Project Directory
After you have finished setting up the system, you need to navigate to the new project directory by typing:
```bash
cd firework-app
```
At this moment you are inside the project directory where you can start developing your application.

### Installing Required Dependencies
Afterward, to present fireworks effects, we have to put another library. It is easier to use and customize than other libraries that are available but not used in this guide like `fireworks-js` and has most tutorials about it. We chose to use `fireworks-js` library for this tutorial because of its simplicity and flexibility. You have the possibility of making different firework effects with parameters that can be changed as you wish with the help of this particular tool.

You should install `fireworks-js` by entering the following text within your command-line interface (CLI):
```bash
npm install fireworks-js
```
