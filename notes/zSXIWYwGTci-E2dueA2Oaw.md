# 法國黃背心與民主的挑戰：翻譯工作區

*What can we expect from the National Debate?*
我們可以期待「全國辯論」的什麼？

We could expect a lot from this National Debate. I am among those who think that democracy’s problems can be solved by furthering democracy. This means recreating spaces and interfaces for discussion between citizens and representatives. This is also about creating a moment of democratic reflexivity where a new political project can be developed based on commonalities between the people, intermediary bodies and elected representatives. Organizing the National Debate for this purpose could have been a historic opportunity. However, the National Debate was organized under great improvisation. Two conditions are required to nurture the will of the public to participate to the debate and to build the credibility of the debate.

作為一個相信民主議題可以透過更多的民主來解決的支持者，我們對這次的全國辯論有很多期待。全國辯論應該是關於如何重新建構一個討論的場域、連結公民和代議士間的新介面，它為民主帶來了一個極大的反思時刻：人民、中介機構和代議士，攜手試圖發展一個新的政治專案和一個新的共識。這理應是一次歷史性的機會，這是全國辯論原本可能組織起來的，然而卻因政府的恣意行動，導致這次國家辯論的不被信賴......為了建立國家辯論的可信度，培養人民參與辯論的意願，應該重視兩個條件。

First, the organizer of the debate must be above suspicion. The CNDP (France's national commission for public debate) played this role and could have played this role well if it had been the only organizer responsible of the quality of debate. However, both the presidency and the government interfered and assumed the organization of the debate. In my view, this is a bad thing because it undermined the credibility of the debate from that point onwards. The debate becomes a mix of political discussion and an exercise of political communication. The letter from the President is an example of this.

首先，組織全國辯論的單位必須是可信賴的。CNDP(法國國家公開辯論委員會)曾負責此角色，且應可舉辦的很好，因為它曾是唯一舉辦此層級辯論會的唯一組織。然而，總統和政府都干涉並預設此單位負責此辯論會。在我來看，這是一件壞事，因為它破壞了辯論的可性度，。辯論成為政治討論和政治溝通的混合體(?)。如總統的信就是例子之一。

The second necessary condition for a credible debate is that the government makes a commitment in advance to take into account the substance of the debate into its decision-making. However, the government has imposed restrictions at this level. Although the president’s letter indicated that nothing is above debate, the reinstatement of the ISF (Solidarity tax on wealth), for example, is not up for discussion. This is peculiar given that, for instance, taxation will be an important issue for debate. Citizens are not idiots. When they are told: “Come to debate but we will not listen to what you have to say”, of course they won’t come. Therefore, my view is that the debate lacks credibility. This ultimately casts a large shadow on the National Debate and the appropriate consideration allocated to its substance. 

進行可信辯論的第二個必要條件是政府事先作出承諾，將辯論的結果實質在決策中被考慮。但是，政府在這個層面施加了限制。儘管總統的信表明沒有任何爭論(?)，但例如ISF（對財富的團結稅）的恢復並不被討論。這是特殊的，例如，稅收將成為辯論重點。公民不是白痴，當他們被告知：“來討論，但我們不會聽你說的話”，當然他們不會來。 因此，我認為辯論缺乏可信度。這最終給國家辯論投下了大量陰影。

*What should we debate about?*

我們應該辯論什麼？

This is what makes the debate a complex issue in itself. Several radical options are possible.

這就是為什麼辯論本身就是一個複雜的問題。幾種激進的選擇都是可能的。

The first option is to say that we are going to debate about everything and that everything can be questioned. My opinion is that this is incompatible with the very logic of representative democracy. The government won the election and has a political program to implement. It is also quite a complicated option to put into practice.

第一種選擇是說我們將就所有事情進行辯論，並且所有事情都可以受到質疑。我的觀點是，這與代議制民主的邏輯是不相容的。政府贏得了選舉，並製定了政治計劃。這也是一個複雜而難以實行的選擇。

The second option is to say that we have predetermined themes and selected questions for the debate. This is the option endorsed in President Macron’s letter. But then again this is far too restrictive. Democratic debates and participative democracy history remind us that citizens do what they want and raise the issues they care for the most when given the floor. This always goes beyond the scope of the debate.

第二種選擇是說我們有預定的主題和選定的問題供辯論。這是馬克龍總統的信中所贊同的選擇。但是，這又是一個過於嚴格的限制。民主辯論和參與式民主歷史提醒我們，公民會按照自己的意願行事，並在發言時提出他們最關心的問題。這總是超出了辯論的範圍。

In my option, both are unacceptable options. We need a middle path. It cannot be (1) “debating about everything” because we are in a representative democracy. Neither can it be (2) “answering questions” which would not be much different from surveying citizens since they can not raise (by themselves) the issues they care for.

在我的選擇中，兩者都是不可接受的選擇。我們需要一條中間道路。它不可能是（1）“爭論一切”，因為我們處於一個代議制的民主國家。也不能（2）“回答問題”與調查公民沒有太大區別，因為他們不能（自己）提出他們關心的問題。

*What are the alternatives?*

有哪些替代方案？

Our election-based political system is the product of our history with representative democracy. In this system, since the end of the eighteenth century, the election is supposed to materialize the popular sovereignty, to give it a reality. Election is the democratic procedure of a regime that also still has clear aristocratic elements (cf. Bernard Manin). We designate selected and elected representatives. The words “elite” and “election” have the same origin: to select. In the interval between elections, citizen stay at home and have no legitimacy to participate in the decision-making process.

我們以選舉為基礎的政治制度是我們歷史以來代議制民主的產物。在這個體系中，自十八世紀末以來，選舉應該實現人民主權，使其成為現實。選舉是一個政權的民主程序，也有明顯的貴族元素（參見Bernard Manin）。我們指定選定的和當選的代表。 “精英”和“選舉”這兩個詞的起源相同：選擇。在選舉期間，公民待在家裡，沒有參與決策過程的合法性。


The mechanism of the election produces legitimacy or it used to produce legitimacy, and, to some extent, consent, which means that we recognize ourselves in those who we have elected. At the present time, it no longer produces enough legitimacy. Moreover, citizens have the impression that decisions are being made elsewhere driven by economic powers and that representatives do not have the possibility or the opportunity to govern as they want to. Thus, elections have lost credibility in the public’s eye. We need to envision new and alternative forms of representation. It is hard to govern [a country] without appropriate representation. A country of this scale cannot be governed with pure horizontality. We need more and different forms of democratic representation. The sortition (selection by lot) allows to choose representatives […] that won’t be distorted by the fact that they are "professionals of representation" (professional representatives). What about citizen assemblies selected by lot? A citizens’ initiative referendum is of the upmost interest to reinvigorate representative democracy. Citizens in Switzerland, the US and Italy, and in many other countries, can raise issues they care for through petitions. Citizens can interpellate governments through similar mechanisms. We can also think about a right of revocation. This is considered a scary thing in France, but it is used in California without really shocking anyone. It is also been used in Taiwan for a few years. All this to say that we have alternatives, but we need to operate within the framework of a democratic representation, because without democratic representation, it is very likely that we will switch to an undemocratic system.

選舉的機制產生合法性，或者它曾經產生合法性，並且在某種程度上產生了同意，這意味著我們在我們選出的人中認出自己。目前，它已不再具有足夠的合法性。此外，公民的印像是，經濟權力驅動的其他地方正在做出決定，而且代表沒有可能或沒有機會按照自己的意願進行治理。因此，選舉在公眾眼中失去了可信度。我們需要設想新的和替代的代表形式。沒有適當的代表，很難管理[一個國家]。這種規模的國家不能以純粹的水平狀態來管理。我們需要更多不同形式的民主代表。分類（按批次選擇）允許選擇不會被“代表專業人員”（專業代表）這一事實所扭曲的代表。那麼抽籤選出的公民集會呢？公民倡議公投是重振代議制民主的最大利益。瑞士，美國和意大利以及許多其他國家的公民可以通過請願提出他們關心的問題。公民可以通過類似的機制來推翻政府。我們也可以考慮撤銷權。這在法國被認為是一件可怕的事情，但在加利福尼亞使用它並沒有讓任何人感到震驚。它也在台灣使用了幾年。所有這些都說我們有其他選擇，但我們需要在民主代表的框架內運作，因為沒有民主代表，我們很可能會轉向不民主的製度。

*Why is the crisis of representation so strong today?*
為什麼今天辯論代表權的危機如此強烈？

 The crisis of representation is a structural matter in democratic regimes. We have spoken about the crisis of representation for almost fifty years. Until now, what was at stake has been the representativeness of representatives: "they are not like us", "there is no working-class people in the National Assembly" (lower house of the Parliament), "there are not enough women", "there are not enough young people", etc. However, we are dealing now with something more significant. This is a turning point in the perception we have about the crisis of representation. Why is that so? Because two elements have changed.
 代表權危機是民主政權的結構性問題。近五十年來，我們談到了代表權的危機。到目前為止，代表們的代表性是：“他們不像我們”，“國民議會中沒有工薪階層的人”（議會下院），“沒有足夠的女性” ，“沒有足夠的年輕人”，等等。但是，我們現在正在處理更重要的事情。這是我們對代表權危機的看法的轉折點。為什麼會這樣？因為兩個元素已經改變了

First, in the past, we criticized the corruption of representatives and their incompetence. But we did not criticize the institutions of the representative democracy. Today, there is a strong resurgence of the idea of direct democracy. This is visible through the repeated claims for citizens' initiative referendums and citizen assemblies selected by lot. These claims are part of the discourse of the Yellow Vests. The criticism is leveraged at the system.

首先，在過去，我們批評代表的腐敗及其無能。但我們並沒有批評代議制民主制度。今天，直接民主思想強烈復甦。通過重複主張對全民公投和抽籤選出公民代表，可以看出這一點。這些說法是黃色背心話語的一部分。批判性是在系統中被提升。

Second, we see an aversion or a form of allergy to representation. It looks like a post-representative political era. Why is that so? Because citizens no longer tolerate to have spokespersons. They cannot stand anyone talking in their place anymore. There are two reasons for this. By speaking for you, they deprive you of your vocabulary and your own discourse. These spokespersons do not share the same experience as you. To be legitimate nowadays, a representative must share the experience of those he or she represents. As soon as he / she becomes a representative, he / she ceases to be one of those he / she represents.

（機器翻譯）
其次，我們看到厭惡或對表現過敏的形式。它看起來像一個後代表政治時代。為什麼會這樣？因為公民不再容忍有發言人。他們不能忍受任何人在他們的地方說話。有兩個原因。通過為您說話，他們會剝奪您的詞彙量和您自己的話語權。這些發言人與您沒有相同的經歷。為了現在合法，代表必須分享他或她所代表的人的經驗。一旦他/她成為代表，他/她就不再是他/她所代表的人之一。
