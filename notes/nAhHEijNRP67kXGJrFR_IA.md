No one can deny the importance of engine oil in the automotive industry. However, every important thing attracts a lot of myths. The engine oil is not an exception. However, engine oil needs to be intact if you wish to run your vehicle for a longer time with optimum performance. However, there are numerous myths surrounding the use of engine oil.

Let’s get through some common misconceptions and find the truth.

## Myth busted: Your car's engine oil should be changed every 5,000 kilometres.

Though oil change is a requirement, there is no set limit, such as replacing engine oil every 5,000 kilometres. It's possible when some older models lubricate worn components under the hood. Sometimes, a vehicle might need an early call for engine oil due to scarcity, especially when fluid goes unused due to a leak.

Besides, modern cars come with durable engine oil that can last up to 20,000 kilometres. Today, engine oil has improved a lot in terms of viscosity and quality. However, you can refer to your car’s manual for an exact time or just avail of Service My Car’s professional advice.

## Myth busted: Thicker oil is better for engine life and performance.

In the case of lubrication, it seems that thicker oil is a better option. However, thinner oil always works better. They provide optimal lubrication while serving as an eliminator of any kind of contamination.

Apart from that, it is easier to pump thinner oil to reach each and every nook and corner as compared to thicker oil. However, the engine oil viscosity is more relative to the weather, as thicker oil is more suitable in the summer. Car owners who live in areas that sustain higher temperatures for most of the months of the year should use thicker engine oil.

## Myth Busted: There is no need to replace the engine oil filter every time you change the oil in your car.

Engine oil and the filter work in tandem to keep the engine lubricating. While there could be constant contamination in terms of dirt and debris, the oil filter does the work of removing any harmful external agents.

Due to excess utilisation, the oil filters might get clogged, which definitely hampers the performance of a vehicle. As a result, engine oil filter replacement should always be required during car engine oil.

## Myth busted: If engine oil has turned black, it should not be used.

In most cases, the basis of an engine oil change is the distance covered, not the colour. Engine oil might turn black due to the heat of the engine. Besides, some additives also work to remove contaminants, but they can turn engine oil black.

Therefore, black engine oil hints at the proper working of additives. So it is necessary to follow standards as per the car manual to opt for an engine oil replacement. On the other hand, you should seek professional advice from Service My Car.

## Myth Busted: The "W" on engine oil packs is about weight.

Engine oil packs contain a combination of numbers and letters, where "W" stands for winter. The numbers, before and after the "W", indicate the viscosity of oil in heated conditions.

## Myth Busted: Synthetic engine oil can corrode seals.

In the 1970s, this was true due to the fact that synthetic oils were not as good as they are in the current situation. However, technology has advanced over the years, and they are no longer as harmful to seals.

Besides, synthetic engine oil is a better alternative for lubrication in current times. They offer better protection for engine components and are durable even in extreme conditions.  Therefore, you can use synthetic engine oil nowadays without worrying about damage to the seals and, of course, unnecessary leaks.

## Myth Busted: Using different brands of engine oil causes engine damage.

This is utterly a myth, as engine oil needs to be as per specification, while many brands can provide engine oil with similar specifications. Therefore, there is no reason to be afraid of using different brands of engine oil.

However, you should be cautious about the quality of engine oil because there might be a difference in quality even if they have the same specification. For trusted services, you should come to Service My Car.

## Myth Busted: A well-maintained vehicle may use low-quality engine oil.

However, human nature prompts us to save some bucks when there is not a serious requirement. When you choose low-quality engine oil, however, such a decision always has negative consequences and damages the engine. Low-quality engine oil is unable to withstand extreme temperatures and is always contaminated in some way.

So you cannot expect the same level of lubrication that good quality engine oil can provide. Therefore, think twice before opting for low quality engine oil because it will definitely damage an engine over time. And, consequently, you end up paying more for car engine repair.
