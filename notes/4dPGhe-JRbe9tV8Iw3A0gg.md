At a recent professional event, I was introduced to a man who dressed impeccably and had been working the room like a pro. 
His handshake was appropriate, and our initial conversation was pleasant, but he quickly became boastful, stopped listening, and seemed unaware of the people around him. 
Before my eyes, he transformed from a gentleman into a banty roosterâ€”all puff and little substance. Sadly, he was unable to connect in a meaningful way.
