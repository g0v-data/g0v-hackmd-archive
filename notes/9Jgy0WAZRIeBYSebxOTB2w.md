### Description

Participants and members of civic hacking communities in Taiwan (g0v.tw), Japan (Code for Japan), and Korea (Code for Korea) will share reflection on organizing the Facing the Ocean regional network since 2019. Sharing will highlight the inception of the network, its organizational scheme, as well as key moments and projects using tech and collaboration to safeguard information accessibility and integrity against government overreach, authoritarian interference, and (physical) cultural divides.

Examples include an anti-extradition law portal (2019), COVID-19 dashboards (2020-2021), community fact-checking (and its dissolution in Korea), data-driven projects countering misinformation (2023), and AI-assited open parliament (2023).
