## g0v
- chihao> g0v is a decentralized community
- chihao> g0v has no leader
- chihao> g0v has no representative
   - patcon> I will admit always being a bit confused by this self-description. I wonder if it's a language/definition thing. I understand having no _authority_, but in my understanding, every time a member of an "identity group" (which g0v is) acts in the world, it is represented to itself and outsiders. having no represenatives feels in denial of how our brains work and interact. "no representatives" vs "all representatives, but not authority" or "all humble representatives". <3
       - having said that, if everyone understands that to be the case, then it's essentially true :)
- chihao> g0v and OCF is different

## Questions about g0v
### chihao> How many ppl in g0v?
chihao> g0v doesn't have member, only contributors and participants, so there is no definite count of how many ppl

### chihao> where does the money come from?
?

### Dali(GJ翻译bot)> g0v memebers are not full-time, so I was wondering that How does g0v work? Also, How do you initiate and run the project?

chihao> 
1. We usually call ourselves “contributors” or “participants”, not members since g0v is a community, not an organization. (This is according to a [community consensus](https://g0v.hackmd.io/jg7ewPO1Sbejnpr7cdj5Lg?view))(check out `g0vernance` category here: https://g0v.hackmd.io/)
2. g0v projects gain progress when people have time to contribute to them.
3. Many g0v projects are initiated in g0v hackathons. There are the bi-monthly “big hackathons”, moe-dict hackathons, infrastructure hackathons, design hackathons, etc...
4. Now there is a g0v grant, run by jothon, to fund g0v projects

### greenhair(Parti)> What makes people become nobody? (personal idea is ok!)

chihao>
I personally think that all ideas here are personal ;)
Need to think about this question before writing down any nonsense :p
