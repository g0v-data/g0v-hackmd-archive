### Description

Since 2019, participants and members of civic hacking communities in Taiwan (g0v.tw), Japan (Code for Japan), and Korea (Code for Korea) have been organizing the Facing the Ocean regional network. Three presenters will share the inception of the network, its organizational scheme, as well as key moments and projects using tech and collaboration to address communinal, national, and regional issues.

This session will focus on the issue of information accessbility and integrity. Presenters will highlight such projects and efforts connected by the Facing the Ocean network, working against government suppression, authoritarian interference, and (physical) cultural divides in East Asia.

Examples include an anti-extradition law portal (2019), COVID-19 dashboards (2020-2021), community fact-checking (and its dissolution in Korea), data-driven projects countering misinformation (2023), and AI-assisted open parliament (2023).

Presenters will then share a preliminary country comparison of information accessibility and integrity among East Asian countries based on an open dataset of the aforementioned projects, other related efforts, and recent developments in the region.

Slido will be used to collect questions and feedback during sharing. An facilitated open discussion will follow. A shared document will be used throughout the session to create meeting notes and formulate future collaboration.
