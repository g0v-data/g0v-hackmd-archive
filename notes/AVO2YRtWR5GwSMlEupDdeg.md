Running my online shop used to feel like being a detective trying to solve where sales came from. Every morning I'd check Facebook ads then Google ads then my store analytics and nothing ever matched up. Customers would click my Instagram ad but buy three days later and I had no way to connect those dots. Was basically throwing money at different platforms hoping something would stick. Everything changed when I started using [ecommerce automation](https://www.redtrack.io/solutions/e-commerce/) that tracks the whole customer journey automatically. Now when someone sees my ad on their phone but buys on their computer I still know which campaign deserves credit. Makes running ads actually logical instead of just gambling
