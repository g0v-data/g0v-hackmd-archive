Cofacts Editor On-boarding SOP
=====

Whenever you meet someone who’s interested in becoming a Cofacts editor in any situation, please invite that person to sign up as an editor and follow these instructions listed below:

## Introduction and Invitation

Tips for introducing Cofacts: keep it short and simple when introducing how our LINE bot works and get straight to the point - how you can sign up as a volunteer editor and help with our database.

> When you receive a message on LINE but cannot tell if its true.
Forward that message directly to the Cofacts LINE bot.
> If there is already a request in our database, the bot will show you responses related to your issue.
> Anyone can help verify these messages in our database following our editor’s code-of-conduct.
> We have thousands of pending LINE message requests which needs your help verifying.
