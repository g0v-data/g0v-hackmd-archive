### Beginning

#### Host:
Despite the recent spike in cases, Taiwan has been hailed for its coronavirus response. Its fast and efficient policies have drawned praise from around the world.

Take this website (for example), it's called "[the Mask Map](https://kiang.github.io/pharmacies/)". It provides upto date information on where people can buy face masks. The site was created by computer programmers known as "Civic Hacktivists". Over the past decades, they have developed a fruitful partnership with the government. Particularly, not just the coronavirus but the wide range of social issues.

### Mask Map

#### Reporter:
Here's the man who developed Mask Map, Howard Wu. The idea came to him in early 2020. The virus had just started spreading and Howard noticed something happening on the street.

#### Howard:
The lines were super long. Everyone seemed to be afraid.

#### Reporter:
At the time, Taiwanese people were hoarding masks, leading to a serious shortage. For programmer like Wu, the solution seemed obvious: build a website that allows people to check in real time which store has masks before they left home. Then, they wouldn't have to line up.

#### Howard Wu:
I wanted to solve the problems affecting my life as well as many others.

#### Reporter:
But there was a problem, Wu didn't have the access to the information he needed to develop the site. This is the first version of Mask Map. Because he didn't have inventory data, he relied on updates from users to indicate general availability: sold out, only a few remaining, or plenty. 

The next day, Taiwan's digital minister, Audrey Tang, posted on the civic hacktivist site and she suggested collaboration. "Please don't rush disclosure on social media." Tang announced that she would publish the masks sales data that Wu and his fellow activists had been looking for.

There was a reason for the prompt response. The Taiwanese government was having trouble in managing the territory wide masks distribution. Officials had all the data on mask inventory. The problem was that they have been overwhelmed by a flood of inquiries causing their website to crash. That's why Mask Map appeared. Thanks to the civic hacktivists.

#### Sheila Chen:
We hadn't thought about using sales data this way. We will publish as much information as we're permitted to.

#### Reporter:
On February 6, 2020, three days after Audrey Tang's post, the new Mask Map was released. It offered detailed information about salers and inventory.

#### Howard Wu:
We were able to develop the Mask Map which the Taiwanese people have applauded. Thanks to the information published by the government.

### g0v.tw

#### Reporter:
Encouraged by that success, civic hacktivists are ramping up their activities. They chat on a site called "[g0v](https://g0v.tw/)". It's a forum where members can discuss ways to solve social issues, contributing their own knowledge and expertise, while join on published data.

At last count, more than 9500 people including students and IT professionals were providing input. Members organize themselves around particular issues, then purpose solutions to the government and authorities.

This computer app ([Cofacts](https://cofacts.tw/)) is one of the outcomes. It's designed to combat the flood of fake news plaguing social media these days. The program alerts internet users when it detects suspect information. It's also intend to educate web browsers to be more wary when they use search engines.

Ideas like this usually get started at the groups bi-monthly meeting. Anyone can suggest a proposal.

#### Participating hactivist:
We have been identifying and reporting illegal factories. We are requesting the government shut them down based on  on data gathered via a notification system.



Chia-liang Kao launched the g0v. As a civic hacktivist, he's a strong believer in the public's right to information and transparent governance. One event in particular informed his beliefs.

#### Chia-liang Kao:
I was streaming from here, right near this entrance.

#### Reporter:
This building is home to Taiwan's legistlative yuan. In 2014, it was a site of a major demonstration.

Dubbed "the Sunflower Student Movement," young people came in there thousands to protest the trade deal Taiwan had made with China. The students were angry the government had approved the deal without any public discussion. Demanding it be scrapped, they occupied the building. Kao streamed the event live on social media, giving voice to students through fences. The government eventually backed down and shoved the trade agreement with Beijing. Kao says the lesson is clear. Ordinary citizens can change society when they take an active role in politics and leadership.

#### Chia-liang Kao:
We must make our voices heard on issues that require us to speak out. The future depends on all of us working together toward reform and that's not an easy task. Looking at the society in general, there are so many things that need reform.

#### Reporter:
Evolving from a student movement, Taiwan civic hacktivists have grown to the point where policy makers now come to them for ideas. That makes some key players in this society forge in deeper trust between citizens and the authorities.
