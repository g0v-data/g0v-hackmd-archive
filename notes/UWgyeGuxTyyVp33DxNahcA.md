Note 1: Some of these examples are in Spanish. Google Translate for Spanish-to-English is intelligible, and it may be better than the Spanish-to-Korean translation.

Note 2: Almost all projects listed below are open-source on GitHub.

Note 3: I (James) can make introductions to the people responsible for almost any of the projects listed here.

Ways in which companies can influence government, and tools to combat that influence:
1.  Asset disclosure
    1.  In Chile, politicians must, by law, disclose their financial assets and interests (e.g. being a board member or having a controlling share of a company, either directly or through family members). However, the legislature doesn't consistently use this information to identify conflicts of interest, e.g. preventing a politician from voting on a bill that regulates an industry in which they have a financial interest. This application helps find potential conflicts of interest. Their partnership with a local television program produced reactions from the government, politicians and political parties. See some of the coverage at [http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22198/culture-hacking-how-one-project-changing-transparency-chile](http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/22198/culture-hacking-how-one-project-changing-transparency-chile)
2.  Disclosure of lobbyist meetings
    1.  [http://quienmanda.es/](http://quienmanda.es/) by Civio tags politicians and businesspeople in public photographs to annotate which companies are lobbying politicians. Spain has little to no regulation of lobbying. The website serves as both a transparency and a campaign tool to introduce lobbying regulation. There's an English description on their crowdfunding campaign page: [http://en.goteo.org/project/quien-manda](http://en.goteo.org/project/quien-manda)
    2.  Chilean civil society organizations led a multi-year campaign to regulate lobbying. The history is briefly chronicled at [http://leydelobby.cl/historia-del-proyecto.html](http://leydelobby.cl/historia-del-proyecto.html). I haven't been able to find a more in-depth analysis of the campaign.
3.  Political financing
    1.  [http://moneypoliticstransparency.org/](http://moneypoliticstransparency.org/) has many case studies about money in politics in different countries. Here is their evaluation of Korea (6th out of 53): [https://data.moneypoliticstransparency.org/countries/KR/](https://data.moneypoliticstransparency.org/countries/KR/). See also [http://moneypoliticstransparency.org/resources](http://moneypoliticstransparency.org/resources)  for:
        1.  "Global Tools to Explore Money, Politics and Influence"
        2.  "Studies and Recommendations on Political Finance Transparency"
        3.  "Webinar Series Exploring Political Finance Transparency"
    2.  In Chile, there is an active campaign to pass strong political financing legislation. You can see on what points the government and civil society disagree at [http://hayacuerdo.ciudadanointeligente.org/dineroypolitica/](http://hayacuerdo.ciudadanointeligente.org/dineroypolitica/). The main campaign website is [http://quientefinancia.cl/](http://quientefinancia.cl/).
4.  Procurement
    1.  [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/vuesurlescontrats/](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/vuesurlescontrats/) or [http://ffctn.com/clients/vdm/contrats/M17/](http://ffctn.com/clients/vdm/contrats/M17/) are two visualizations of Montreal's contracts data. The latter in particular makes it easier to see which companies receive the most money, and which departments spend the most money. There are many platforms worldwide that simply make procurement data easier to search, which helps investigators.
5.  Bribes
    1.  [http://www.ipaidabribe.com/](http://www.ipaidabribe.com/) is the most popular platform, which has been replicated in many countries. It has been the subject of many case studies, focusing on its impact and sustainability. See, for example, [http://democracyspot.net/2012/09/14/i-paid-a-bribe-so-what/](http://democracyspot.net/2012/09/14/i-paid-a-bribe-so-what/) (Tiago Peixoto's blog is worth following in general).
6.  Dark money, which refers to undeclared donations/contributions to politicians or parties
    1.  The US is one of the countries most affected by dark money, due to the deregulation of political financing (largely through the courts instead of through the legislature). Much of the Sunlight Foundation's reporting focuses on dark money.
7.  Revolving door ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving\_door\_%28politics%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_%28politics%29)), which is one of the ways in which industries may promote deregulation and privatization
    1.  [http://littlesis.org/](http://littlesis.org/) tracks the many different connections between businesspeople and politicians, e.g. through school, employment, lobbyist meetings, campaign financing, etc. In projects like this, the database maintains and increases in value over time, so it is a good, long-term investment.
8.  Commenting on draft regulations
    1.  Docket Wrench ([http://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/docket-wrench/](http://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/docket-wrench/))  by the Sunlight Foundation helps groups investigate the regulatory  process. In particular, it finds similarly-worded public comments to  enable investigators to identify the lobbies among the companies  submitting comments. Watch the video for more information.
9.  Corruption
    1.  In 2009, Global Integrity evaluated the anti-corruption legal frameworks of countries. Korea had the top score (out of 35 countries), and was not included in future years' reports: [https://www.globalintegrity.org/research/reports/global-integrity-report/global-integrity-report-2009/](https://www.globalintegrity.org/research/reports/global-integrity-report/global-integrity-report-2009/)
10.  Ideological hegemony across politics, industry and the media

Different strategies for combating influence:
1.  Lobby for new laws
2.  Help enforce existing laws, e.g. via citizen monitoring
3.  Create good PR for good politicians and/or bad PR for bad politicians
4.  Support the media, e.g. by making it easier to investigate by providing them with government information in more accessible, searchable, or usable formats

Some starting points for planning potential projects:
1.  How is influence currently exercised?
2.  What data do we have about that influence? What data do we need?
3.  What laws exist? How can those laws be better enforced or improved?
4.  How does each part of society contribute (positively and/or negatively) to these issues?
    1.  government
    2.  legislature
    3.  justice system
    4.  companies
    5.  civil society
    6.  media
    7.  academia

In the session, we described some of the challenges in Korea:
- Chilling effects ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)). The mainstream media may lose advertising revenue for covering corruption. (So, there is more coverage by the independent media.) Academics may lose research funding for investigating corporate influence.
- The judicial system has a bias towards the status quo and established interests, and it is not as strong on defending social justice.

Other notes from the session:
- [http://www.peoplepower21.org/](http://www.peoplepower21.org/) People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy (PSPD) monitors the legislature. Its staff/membership is largely made up of professors, researchers, and journalists. It does regular reporting, but no crowdsourcing.
