摘要：
Over the past decade, Taiwan has developed into one of the most innovative participatory democracies on the planet, particularly through the use of digital tools. How did Taiwan get there? How does participation in Taiwan work, what makes it so successful and what can other countries, particularly in Europe, learn from it?

This session will discuss these questions in the context of Taiwan’s rich and active civil society, its specific “failure culture”, where innovation is encouraged and failure is a normal part of the process, its openness to different technical solutions, and the unique connection between government, citizens, and civil society, among other aspects.

Description of the session – purpose, content, panelists
 Short intro on Taiwan – possibly connecting the panel briefly to current events 
1st Input by each panelist: digital participatory democracy in Taiwan (15 minutes)
 Bruno (5 minutes)
 An intro into Taiwan’s democratic and particularly participatory development over the past years.
How Taiwan managed to transition from a one-party state into a vibrant and innovative participatory democracy in very little time.
Possible question: Bruno, you’ve been a close observer of Taiwan’s democratic development. In one of your tweets from 2021 you called it “one of the most advanced democracies”. Considering Taiwan was a one-party state not so long ago, how did that happen? 
Sam and Peter (10 minutes)
An insight into the development and work of Taiwan’s g0v community, its workings, its indiependence, it relationship with the wider citizenry, civil society and government
Possible question: Sam and Peter, you are both active members of Taiwan’s g0v community, a movement of civic hackers that has been highly influential in taking Taiwan’s participatory system to a new level. Can you please give us some insights into what makes that movement special, how it came about, how its operating and continuously creates innovative solutions?
2nd input by each panelist: takeaways for other countries from Taiwan’s digital participatory democracy experience (15 minutes)
 Stefan: In a recent article on Taiwan Insight, Sam wrote: “g0v could be replicated abroad, but perhaps it should not be.” So, what are the takeaways of the Taiwanese experience for other countries and regions, particularly Europe and Germany?
 Bruno: From your experience, having been in Taiwan more than 20 times and having followed its development closely, what can we in Europe learn from it?(5 minutes)
Sam and Peter, from your activism experience in g0v, what can civil society and governments in other countries learn from the way participation works in Taiwan? (10 minute)
Q&A moderated by Stefan (20-30 minutes)
