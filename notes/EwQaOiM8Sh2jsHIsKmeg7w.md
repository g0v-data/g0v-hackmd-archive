My CS2 inventory evolved naturally from playing rather than intentionally investing. Weekly drops pile up over time and even cheap skins can be traded for slightly better ones gradually. Using https://dmarket.com/cs2-wiki/ taught me which collections are discontinued and likely to increase versus active drops that keep getting cheaper. I don't stress about having the most expensive items, just ones I genuinely like using. Some of my favorite skins cost under five dollars but look better to me than hyped up expensive alternatives
