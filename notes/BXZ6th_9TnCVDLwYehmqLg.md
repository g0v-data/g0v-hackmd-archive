## Code for Aichi
2017
When disaster strikes, there are many people who volunteer to help those in need. However, before volunteers can assist, they spend a large amount of time on day-of learning and dispersal. These processes can be done ahead of time online. Project Blooming's main goal is to establish the most efficient way to digitize this whole process and store data by using a Cloudant database. In doing so, volunteers can maximize their efforts to actually help people and those in need will get help as soon as possible.

Blooming, Code for Aichi
 
Coordinator outside the spot can control the volunteer
有餘裕
What can I do 
What I want to do

The coordinator can get the information from volunteers and actual spot
The actual spot person can report they need gasoline, water,
The coordinator can match the people and the resources 


Watson can categorize the natural sentences to report: 自動聚合

Just idea and prototyping
Next step must to try in some places
E.g. chiba and fukishima
Want to collaborate with local government
Not only in disaster but also in large event
Volunteer management system

Is this system really useful?


One team member is disaster volunteer staff
He wants to save the time and the disaster respond
He is the project leader


如果拿到 IBM Code for Code 會有獎金

10 月會知道結果

IBM provides tech support, professional supports

It will be open source

Want to finish it this year

Who you want to work with?
Disaster system is very complicated
Many people want to help disaster
NPO helps
Government helps
Company helps


We committed to this week
5 hr/week
Mainly online, sometime offline

If similar project?
I am happy
We want to solve this problem
I want to share
Want to make better solution

日本不同城市會一起合作嗎？
很困難

Our issue
