## Introduction
Clément: I am urban designer with a personnal interest on citizen participation, open government. I went to g0v summit this year to share some experience I had in Taïwan related to that (臺灣好植地, unilimited cities app, [都市設計、公民科技與城市改善 ? - 台灣經驗](https://summit.g0v.tw/2020/agenda/2020-12-05/5ef9c9cbba206b030d66a3b1)). I also work as journalist for the french department of Radio Taiwan International and plan to introduce g0v summit 2020 to our listeners. I've contacted few people, Chihao is one of them, to ask few questions about the organization of the event and its issues. Show is not live, and I will not keep everything we record for theprogram but will provide a public record of our discussion.
