clkao: co-founder, village chief, less available to contribute recently, Jothon's discussion & fund raising

AU: ppl with high agency (challenge impossible), web 3 + g0v, role of plus plus (++), infrastructure quality  

Noah: "high" newbie, web 3, project owner of DAO zero


**_Your definition of decentralization_** 

clkao:
- technical: how to push things forward 
- social layer: how to make a decision, whats the priority
- democracy layer

AU: digital = plurial; it's sustainable community with scale possibility.

clkao:

AU: how to maintain inter-discipilinary 

Noah: 

--
AU: from experience of open-source collaborative editing tool's migration, we learn web 2 tools are still centralized, web 3 tools are more decentralized 

Noah: some social network based on block chain tech allow ppl to migrate with their own network. 

Isabelle: We changed the wording from decentralizing to multicentralization in our manifesto, is that because we admit the failure that decentralization is impossible to achieve?

**_Is the centralization always evil? Is decentralization alway more ideal? What should we do if the public are not all wise but manipulated by information?_** 

AU: sometimes centralization is better sysmtem for example pandemic management. 


**_g0v has always been decentralized, how blockchain tech can change g0v?_**

clKao: decentralization is necessary to make everyone start doing things on their own. 

AU: It's imporant to find concensus from grassroot level, but somethimes emmergency situation donest have time for concensus (example: Quadratic Funding)

**_IS web3 doing similar things that g0v already has done?_**

clKao: 

AU: I am happy to see ppl come up with new tools, so more possibilities appears for what we couldn't due to technical limits
