A car’s engine efficiency remains at its best when it just rolls off from dealership. However, there might be a dip in combustion process over time. And, it might hit a low at a point of time.

Before delving deep, let’s understand about the engine efficiency first.
 
## What does engine efficiency mean?

In scientific term, the efficiency of a car’s engine signifies the capacity of turning the thermal energy into mechanical energy. If an engine does not convert fuel into engine power properly, it is said to have a low level of efficiency. 

Engines that burn fuel are incredibly inefficient. In other words, only half of the energy, an engine uses to power a vehicle. It appears huge.

While it may seem like a vehicle is incredibly inefficient if it only converts half of the thermal energy it produces during combustion into mechanical energy, many vehicles on the road actually waste far more than this energy. More than 80% of the energy produced by gasoline engines frequently escapes the engine's exhaust pipe or is lost to its surroundings.

However, there might be some mechanical reasons that might drag the engine’s efficiency down. Fuel injector problems or ECM (Electronic Control Module) malfunctioning or even a clogged air filter, etc hampers the engine capacity of generating mechanical energy.

However, if you want to have more from your car’s engine, these are some valuable points to deal with lagging engine efficiency. 

## Ensure your Ignition process is working properly

Despite a proper level of supply of fuel and level, if there is any problem with ignition. You cannot expect proper efficiency of combustion process.

There is no provision of sending any intimation to the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) if you have a bad ignition system. However, a tiniest of issue might hamper your car engine efficiency. In most cases, eventually, worn spark comes out as a culprit. On the other hand, some burnt ignition coils may default in providing proper current to a vehicle.

Higher voltage requirement cause each spark plug to ignite if the air to fuel ratio is leaner and there is a greater percentage of air in the mixture. To get the most out of the engine, you need an ignition system that carefully times the spark plugs. If you have spark mistiming, you would not have proper combustion and eventually bad engine power.

Therefore, a professional assessment is always worth when it comes to such problems.

However, these things are not visible and come into experience until you consult with a professional at Service My Car.

However, a lower voltage issue has a solution in form of amplifier. This surely boosts the amount of electricity goes through the wire to the spark plug. 

Beside, you can opt for spark plugs replacement at Service My Car at very affordable rates.

## Ensure throttle and injectors health

The throttle works as a administrator while controlling the fuel injectors. It ensures that injectors should provide the perfect quantity of fuel into cylinder. However, a throttle does not possess too much problem until it finds itself stuck.
 
Besides, the air filter might be a problem to improper air to fuel ratio. The engine intakes the fresh air through environment and it gets through the air filter before going into the combustion chamber. A clogged air filter causes the problematic internal combustion. 

However, you cannot asses or guess about these problems until visit to a qualified mechanic.  If you are keen to know about improvising vehicle torque, your air and fuel supply system should be intact. Service My Car facilitates you with car scanning and diagnostics services to pinpoint various issues including engine problems and you also get air filter replacement to get your car’s engine efficiency back. 

## Try to use Additives

There are a number of additives available that can improve your car’s engine combustion process These fuel catalysts are one of the simplest means of improving the combustion efficiency of heavy fuels while they also helps in cleaning the fuel injectors.

Besides, you can opt for motor oil that comes in conventional, synthetic and blend varieties.  In others synthetic offers prolonged existence, resilience and all-temperature usability.

## Never neglect Your Vehicle maintenance

Maintaining your engine comes at top in learning how to increase vehicle efficiency. Since, there are a lot of other things such as engine oil and coolant, etc that need to be proper if you expect your vehicle to perform at its level best.

Your engine will perform at its best if you take care of it. However, your efforts to improve engine performance will be ineffective if you neglect to change the oil and check worn-out parts on a regular basis. Even the best additives won't significantly improve your engine's performance if you use them with low quality gas or oil.

Service My Car offers you comprehensive car service including car oil change, oil filter replacement, etc at very affordable rates.

By following these points, you can a significant improvement in your car engine’s efficiency. But, you should opt for a quality work shop that handles your automobile needs properly.
