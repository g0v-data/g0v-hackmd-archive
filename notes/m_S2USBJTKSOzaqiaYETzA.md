## About the researcher and the research

大家好，我是李梅君，在 g0v slack 上的 ID 是 MG Lee。我是一位人類學家，任職於中研院民族所，研究台灣的數位行動主義與開放運動，並從 2016 年起參與在 g0v 中。([我的學術頁面](https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Researcher/content.aspx?&SiteID=530367205133077215&MenuID=530400021400001437&Fid=0&MSID=1162145622231424732))

今年初開始，我與 Sam Robbins 合作，希望挖掘面海松的國際串連，特別關於面海松這個東亞的公民科技網絡是否可能"解殖"公民科技。我在年初時訪談了來自三地的部分參與者，並在IGU-TC研討會中發表過草稿「Facing the Ocean: Decolonizing Civic Tech in an East Asian Archipelago of Activism」。原本我預計參與剛結束的濟州島面海松進行田野調查，來補足缺少的材料，但因為健康因素最後未能成行，因此希望能透過共筆的形式，徵求參與者的經驗分享。

Hi, my name is Meichun Lee 李梅君 or MG Lee on the g0v slack. I am an anthropologist studying digital activism and open movements in Taiwan. I am also a g0v participant since 2016. Currently I work in the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica in Taiwan. ([My academic profile](https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Researcher/content.aspx?&SiteID=530367205133077215&MenuID=530400021400001437&Fid=0&MSID=1162145622231424732))

Since the beginning of this year, I have been collaborating with Sam Robbins to explore the international connections of the Facing-the-Ocean Hackathon, particularly regarding the potential decolonization of civic tech within this East Asian network. I conducted a few interviews with FtO participants and presented a draft titled "Facing the Ocean: Decolonizing Civic Tech in an East Asian Archipelago of Activism" at the IGU-TC conference. To gahter additional materials, I had planned to conduct field research at the FtO hackathon, Jeju. However, due to health reasons, I was unable to attend. Therefore, I am seeking participants' experiences and insights through this collaborative note.

## Questions

### 1) 請用一句話或三個關鍵字簡介一下你自己，以及你為什麼參與這次 FtO Jeju？ / Please introduce yourself (in a setence or in 3 keywords) and share why you attended FtO Jeju 2023.
> Hi I'm Eunsoo, I was one of the organisers from Code for Korea. It was my first time attending FtO. [name=eunsoo]

### 2) FtO 怎麼和當地(濟州島)連結，不管是議題上、文化交流上、或是黑客松裡的互動 / How does FtO connect with the locality (Jeju Island), in terms of social issues, cultural exchange, or interactions during the Meet & Hack event?
> I think we didn't manage to weave in the local histories/context so explicitly during this FtO event. However there were informal conversations between participants comparing the experience of the islands - Jeju, Okinawa, Taiwan - and their common histories of state violence. [name=eunsoo]

### 3) 來自不同地方參與者如何跨越語言與文化的隔閡 (不論成功或失敗) / How do participants from different places overcome language and cultural differences or barriers (successfully or not)?
> We always joke that when Asians come together, language is less of a barrier. We feel like we don't always have to explain ourselves to be understood - there's a level of mutual understanding that's already there - maybe because we look similar? Though I remember some participants from Taiwan saying that there's more representation of people with legal backgrounds in FtO because they speak better English. So there's definitely already a filtering - because we don't provide translation/interpretation during the event. [name=eunsoo]

### 3.1) 你是否有參與在跨國協作的專案裡？請簡述一下專案，和協作的經驗。/ Do you participate in any cross-country projects? If yes, please briefly introduce the project and share your experience. 
> added a new question for group hangout on June 21[name=MG Lee]



### 3.2) 黑客松外有什麼互動？是否有些跨文化的交流？/Do you participate in any activities beyond the hackathon? Is there any cultural exchange?
> added a new question for group hangout on June 21[name=MG Lee]


### 4) FtO 和歐美的公民科技活動與網絡有什麼不同 / What’s different with FtO when compared with European or American civic tech events and networks?

> That FtO is regionally focused. [name=chihao]
> I feel that it's more informal and friendship based than professional, which is what I like about FtO. People are not attending it to add a line on their CV. They come for genuine conversations. [name=eunsoo]

### 5) 這次 FtO Jeju 讓你印象最深刻的人或事或物？ / Please share something that impressed you the most at FtO Jeju 2023.
