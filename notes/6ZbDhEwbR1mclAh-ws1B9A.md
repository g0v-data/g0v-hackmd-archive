## What is disinfoRN? (formerly disinfoRG)
A networked effort powered by g0v community (open-source, loosly-organized, openly-collaborative, in accordance with [g0v Manifesto](https://g0v.tw/en-US/manifesto.html)) currently hosted by many g0v contributors, projects, and taskforces to **document** and **research** disinformation, and (hopefully) to strengthen Taiwan’s civil society in its digital/information/media literacy.
