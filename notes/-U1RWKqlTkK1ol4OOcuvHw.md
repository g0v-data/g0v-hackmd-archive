# g0ver × NDI: interviewing g0vers for a civic tech video

Hi there! My name is Victoria from [NDI](https://www.ndi.org/) and I am working on a short documentary-like video on civic tech/g0v/and democracy. My organization has been a friend of g0v and Code for All for many years (I have met a few of you at various times in Taipei :)) and I am really excited for this opportunity. You can read more about the schedule of filming here: https://g0v.hackmd.io/HaIQVQpLQ8i-ixUDyXtBCQ

Please find my interview questions below which will be used for the video regarding g0v and your work (I will be interviewing three people from the community - someone representing 0archive, someone representing cofacts, and someone from g0v who is also in government), I look forward to your input!

Tech that strengthens the civil society.

### What is g0v (what is g0v’s history)?
it started with a group of people in 2012. back then when they faced the government of Taiwan at the time was promoting certain policies in a "just trust the gov and don't worry about it" attitude, they decided to roll up their sleeves and find out what the government actually is doing, using tech tools.  by inspiring more people to join their cause in an open collaborative way, we as a community established our values on open collaboration, hands-on spirit to solve the problem instead of talking about it, and care for civil society.

### What does g0v do?
g0v is a community of people and projects.

### As an individual, can you tell me how and why you got involved in g0v?

g0v is not an organization. it is a community of people and projects.
