MDMI - Mis/dis/mal-information - Attacks & Responses
=====

## License
CC BY 4.0 2019 Facing the Ocean Meet & Hack participants

## Why?
I have been collecting cases from different countries on disinformation **attack and response** both from civil society and governments.

Language barrier & physical distance prevents much conversation & research beyond apparent events covered by English / international press.

FtO is a good opportunity to start this conversation with people from J + K + HK.

## [Attack]


## [Response] TV monitor project

- [portal](https://g0v.hackmd.io/c/HJJH5046V/)

## [Response] Social Listening & Tracking

### Evaluating http://page.board.tw/farm/

- tracks articles from identified farm, and shared by various facebook pages, within 3 days

Q: who are the next hubs?
Q: how to determine hub-like node?
Q: what does it look like from the facebook page perspective?

### What problems are we trying to solve?

- legislation: pattern of actors
- judicial forensics support
- real time / early warning
- cross reference with different SNS/Messaging

### Ideas

- cross-platform annotation for identical/similar content
- sample:
