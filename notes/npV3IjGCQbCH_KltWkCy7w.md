    - differs per org, depends on work and size
    - discounts
- hotdesks? it's very different in korea. ppl want different things. western model might not work

    - social innovation vs traditional innovation

    - :star: look up quote
        - https://twitter.com/patconnolly/status/962033898258509824
    - Why? lots of ppl above 50 have been forcibly retired
    - crisis in 98. financial crisis. many unemployed. after crisis, really hard to find jab after 50.
    - lots of 50+ open businesses together. but too many ppl, so not sustainable. 50+ campus is about finding new paths for them.
- youth unemployment is also a challenge
- ttcat: what happens when full? what is the process of becoming a partner?
- most recsources are from gov. some have issue with this. ppl are kickstarting to bring the land into commons.
- parliaments of democracys. it's an organization. will be hosting them. like a small gov in seoul. assembly and gov and council committee. shadow government. "the way he descibes it is small gov, but i see it as esetablishing a structure where the city gov can propose solutions. budget comes from civil gov. for public. != citizen/participatory budget. citizen's assembly."
- ttcat: anyone related to civic tech? NPO IT support centre. tech soup.
- two types of space
    - open space, able to be used by anyone at any time of day (used to be 24h access, but then creep-O's)
    - 2nd space is office space. limitations.
- 3 goals of coming to tw
    - 1. understand similar space
    - meet lots of small orgs like OCF
    - 2. start diaologue with orgs and spaces here
    - want to intro organizations w orgs in TW
    - 3. to evolve better society, we must not have silo'd communties at country level
