A wheel alignment, as the name suggests, is the configuration of wheels along the axle as well as the road. It means the wheels should have proper adjustment with each other at certain angles while properly attached to an axle.

The wheel adjustments often get disturbed over time due to uneven riding while crossing over the bumps and potholes. A tire alignment requires square adjustments of the wheels with each other so they can move in tandem.

It is accomplished by adjusting a few parts and configuring and positioning the suspension system correctly. 

The procedure entails configuring the steering wheel into the center precisely and adjusting all suspension angles that affect tire movement and positioning.

However, this requires a certain level of expertise to deal with the misalignment, and an expert at a reliable service center would be a good choice.
