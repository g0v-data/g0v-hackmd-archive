# Appendix

Previous distribution rationale (denied)
- Time-based distribution would skew distribution towards curators much, while the effort of the curators are vital, its efforts scales after a couple of classes.
- We will still base distribution on time, but take curators' scalable effort into consideration.
- Another issue is some classes are shared by multiple speakers, we will still use time-based distribution on this.
- It is better to issue Hypercerts after the semester is over, another way to do this is to issue after every class
    - Option A : End of semester distribution
        - Every class : Fraction of 6 for each class
            - Because we have either one, two, three or six speakers at every class
                - 1 speaker : fraction of 6
                - 2 speakers : each gets fraction of 3
                - you know the math
        - Host & Curators : Fraction of 14 for each host and curator
            - We've planned 16 weeks of classes, let's say the importance of planning takes up the same amount effort for every class, that'd be fraction of 6 for for each class, that amounts to fraction of 96. There are seven of us, easiest thing to do is to round up to 98 and assign 14 to each of us.
        - Mentors : Fraction of 6 for each mentor
            - We've planned 2 hours for each, that'd be fraction of 6 for each of them similar to a class
    - Option B : End of class distribution
        - We will follow the logics above, and distribute after every class, this is a little trickier because it's harder to calculate one's impact on the whole project (現在是以百分比呈現), but on individual courses, this might present challenges to buyback.
