[00:06:11] Django and Tofus discuss how contributions in open source design are often harder to track on platforms like GitHub, but they are equally important, and many g0v participants are not coders but contribute in significant ways. He also explains using HackMD, a note taking platform.

[00:12:13] Tofus reflects on his contributions as a high school student, participating in g0v School001 project, which promotes hackathons and the spirit of civic hacking to high school students in Taiwan.

[00:14:53] Tofus discusses his participation in Da0, a study group exploring decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Although not fully developed, the project brought together people interested in blockchain and its potential applications for grassroots communities.

[00:17:30] Tofus highlights the vital role of design in open source. He worked on visual design projects for multiple initiatives, including creating an interactive UI for Da0’s reputation accounting system.

[00:19:54] Django and Tofus dive into projects such as the Plurality Book, an open source book exploring the future of democracy and technology. Tofus worked on the visual design for the book and helped refine its logo.
