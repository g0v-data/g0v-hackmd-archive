**Bio(中文)**: 歡迎來聽 g0v underground 第一集英文節目！今天由社群參與者 Sam 訪問長期觀察、參與、貢獻社群的 MG 與 Chihao。Sam、MG、Chihao 都是從研究 g0v 開始入坑，成為今日社群中活躍的參與者。本集將從他們三個人的經驗出發，討論他們各自進入 g0v 的過程、社群中貢獻與協作的精神、以及黑客文化，希望讓想認識或是參與 g0v 的新手可以找到適合自己參與社群的方式。

**Bio (Egnlish）** Welcome to the first English episode of g0v underground! Today community participant Sam Robbins interviews MG and Chihao, who are both long term observers, participants and contributors to the g0v community. Sam, MG and Chihao all joined g0v through research the community and have now become frequent and active contributors. In this episode, the participants discuss their experience with g0v, including how they entered g0v, the spirit of contribution and collaboration within the community, and the idea of ‘hacker culture’. We hope that this episode can help those who want to learn more about g0v or new community participants to find their way to enter into the community

### 2. g0v and fun 

general idea: I (Sam)wrote an article about fun in the g0v community and I want to keep exploring this theme https://taiwaninsight.org/2021/05/20/fun-politics-and-the-politics-of-fun-in-taiwans-g0v-community/ 

**Potential questions** 
1) What makes g0v fun?
2) When I was doing interviews, so many people brougth up fun. Why is fun important to the g0v community? 
4) Funnest memories from g0v
5) can fun be political?
6) does having fun make it difficult to get serious work done?
7) Does fun help 鞏固g0v社群感
