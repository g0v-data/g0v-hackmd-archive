# vTaiwan's open-legislation methodology in Japan

## What I try to tell in the article

- 推廣開源、CC0 的益處。
    - vTaiwan 論文、開放錄影及逐字稿，讓 code for japan 快速地掌握 vTaiwan open legislation process 的要點，並自己嘗試舉辦一場。
    - 讓彼此的交流，直接進入到討論進階的方法、執行上的細節。 Like how to host workshop in two-days.

- 第二天的議題（遠距工作）
    - 如何創造一個舒適的環境讓大家能夠自在的發言。
    - 民眾的感覺也是很重要的一件事情，人際關係、小孩育幼園津貼
    - 食物很重要!!
    - Slack 好難用
    - 雖然在 vTaiwan 我們開放逐字稿，但我們仍會給予一段時間修改措辭。

- 印章公會 - 電腦及自動化消滅工作
    - 牛津的研究，機器人與 AI 的影響
    - 工作不是單純的被消滅，它改變了
    - How UDTalk help in translating between English and Japanese

## Article
In Mar. 9 and 10 2019, Code for Japan hosted two open-legislation workshops with different issues. And vTaiwan's  participants was invited to talk about concepts about open-legislation and how it works in Taiwan.
"How to do you manage to host this excellent workshop and where do you learn to host it?" I asked to a member of Code for Japan. 

### Advantage of Creative Common
"We learn it mostly from [vTaiwan's paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xyhft/) and online materials of workshop in Tornoto hosted by [PDIS(Public Digital Innovation Space)](https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/)."
The materials mentioned above are all published in Creative Commons (CC) license. Which means you can freely use it without asking. It's turely amazing that it not only provides transparency in legislation process but also helps Code for Japan prepare the workshop efficiently. And so that we can discuss advanced method and details like how to host it in two-days long or how to merge each groups' [Mind Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map).

### Provide a comfortable space
It is also important to having a comfortable space for everyone in hosting workshop. First of all, discussing policy taking a lot of mental effort. Snack and food are required to boost our brain same as in hackathon. Second, making participants feel free to speak for themselves. In day2 workshop we talked about telework. Enable to have a well interpersonal relationships in company are as important as hardware infrastructure needed. In vTaiwan, participants can edit their own transcript of discussion before we publish it such that they don't have to worry about the misunderstanding of the words they said and feel free to speak out.

### To touch all concerns of the issues
In day1 the issue is Digital Authentication. Right now in Japan heavily use stamp for authentication and individual number system called [My Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Number) was just introduced in 2015. Just before the workshop, there were news about stamp union strongly against to the change. Although we did have two participants from stamp business, the workshop was focus on how to put it good use to daily life and popularize it. It was a little regret to me for not mentioning the situation in stamp union and let participants think how to help them to adapt the big change. 
In fact, the similar industrial change may occur frequently in recent decade due to the revolution of A.I. and automation. People often talk about it in apocalyptic terms, but more precisely speaking, robots can help us with simple task without too much thinking and people can pay more attention about decision making task. The jobs are not always lead to lost, they sometimes changed. Take UDTalk for example, an A.I. translation software is used in our presentation and is developed by participants of Code for Japan, although it was not always having a good version of translation, thanks for the fast speech recognition and the synchronize parallel display, it helps local translators to focus on how to clearly deliver the idea within the words.

Thank Code for All for helping us booking the flying tickets and hotel reservation. And thank Code for Japan for having us during 2-days of workshop. The japanese omelette(玉子焼き) in lunch is amazing.
