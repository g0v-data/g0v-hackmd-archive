# Small Data

> [點此觀看原始內容](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/k2EBlhc9ENj)


Big (public) data is great, but sometimes a little bit of complementary \*small\* non public data is vital.  I made a suggestion at the Data Science Conference last Sunday and Audrey Tang suggested that I dig a ditch for myself.  So here you go.

(1) source --> secure channel
(2)             --> secure database
(3)              --> internal vetting with known information
(4)              --> encrypted publication
(5)              --> full disclosure

There are well-known technologies for (1), (2) .
(3)  up to the implementation
(4)  follow the idea of SCIpher, for example
