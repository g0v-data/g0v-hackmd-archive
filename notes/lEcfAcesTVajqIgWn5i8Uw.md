# Open AI grant proposal - vTaiwan 2.0 [draft]

## Abstract
#### complex issues: requires input from international communities and persistant attention
The most important issues we are facing today are the ones without a single owner.
vTaiwan is an open consultation process that is known for reaching rough consensus from diverse perspectives for digital regulatory reform, therefore its outcomes informs decision making with greater ligitimacy.
However, it is not perfect. The establishment of a topic on vTaiwan has been time consuming dues to the requirements to receive commitments from authorities and societal interest groups or individuals. It's hard to track or maintain commitments while topic evolves, more stakeholders become relevant to be invited to the discussion. 

#### revamp vTaiwan to facilitate global and continuous conversation
Through this opportunity to improve vTaiwan, we have come up with a self-defined challange: How might we leverage the existing vTaiwan process and transform it as a platform for open commitments that welcomes input to continuous topic? We hope that this platform we referred as vTaiwan 2.0 inspires individual's continuous input as they grow their understanding, konwledge and care toward to a certain complex topic.

The vTaiwan community has come up with the following proposal for a more continuous vTaiwan (vTaiwan 2.0) drawing from its learnings and experience in operating and fine-tuning the process through out the past 10 years.

## Introduction

### Introduction to vTaiwan

vTaiwan is a civic tech initiative that originated in Taiwan. It is an online platform that engages citizens in policy discussions and decision-making processes.

vTaiwan is an initiative that originated in Taiwanâ€™s civic tech community. It provides an organic (flexible, iteratable) and hybrid process (in-person and virtual engagment) that engages citizens in policy making process, espeically in digital regulatory reform. It proves particularly valuable in addressing emerging technologie, inviting the public, and topic-relevant stakeholders in discussions regarding the necessary regulations.

Notable instances where vTaiwan has been instrumental include the regulation of UberX and Unmanned Aviation Vehicles (UAV) where the process facilitates diverse inputs from large participation and delivers bridging-based statements that informs principles in policy making.

## Issues chosen:
In which cases, if any, should AI assistants offer emotional support to individuals?

### The reason why we choose this issue

### What we expected from the discussion set

## AI > vTaiwan: How can AI empower vTaiwan? 

- use AI to help make a screenshot of current status of debat

### Problems of vTaiwan

#### Lacking of volunteers

#### no issues raised



## vTaiwan > AI: How can vTaiwan make AI more trustworthy and democratic?  

After showing the potential of how AI can empower vTaiwan, this part will demostrate how vTaiwan can improve the democracy of AI, adding more voice from civil society, and become a hub for cooperation of different agencies, different countries and different sectors to happen. 

### Make voice from civil society to be heard by developers, designer, deployer 

Accroding to NIST AI Risk Management Framework 2023, Every part of AI life circle needs to have the risk management. And the core of the risk management is to have the communities andd different stakeholders with life experience and domain knowledge to participate into the discussion of the design, development, deployment and application of AI technology. However, currently we are lacking a feasible and trustworthy mechanism to bridge different stakeholders in the process. 

Hopefully we still have vTaiwan. vTaiwan mechanism contains virtual opinion collection, discussion and record, which is very suitable for the process to happen. vTaiwan also has several sucessful examples which can prove the effectiveness of this process. Unlike petition mechanism, vTaiwan focuses on the discussion and opinion from different stakeholders, which is suitable for AI governance, since the potential and problems of AI vary from different stages of AI life circle and different context. 


### vTaiwan can be a platform for cross-agencies,cross-governments, and cross-sectors (gov, business, society) discussion. 

vTaiwan has the full potential as a outer platform to organize the discussion.
