KYIV, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Russian forces pounded Ukrainian cities with artillery and cruise missiles on Saturday for a third day running but a defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the capital Kyiv remained in Ukrainian hands.

俄羅斯透過火砲與巡弋飛彈進攻烏克蘭已進入第三日，然而頑抗的烏克蘭總統 Volodymyr Zelenskiy 稱基輔仍在烏克蘭的掌控之下。

As hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fled westwards towards the European Union, top Russian security official and ex-president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow's military operations would be waged relentlessly until their goals were achieved.

當數十萬烏克蘭人西退至歐盟，俄羅斯軍事領袖與前總統 Dmitry Medvedev 表示直到莫斯科的軍事行動目的達成之前他們不會停止。

Ignoring weeks of Western warnings, President Vladimir Putin launched a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, saying the "neo-Nazis" in power in Kyiv threatened Russia's security. The assault threatens to upend Europe's post-Cold War order.

總統Vladimir Putin無視西方數週的警告，於本週四由三個戰線對烏克蘭發動侵攻。Vladimir Putin主張基輔的新納粹主義抬頭將對俄羅斯造成威脅。這項侵攻撼動了歐洲的後冷戰秩序。

In a significant ratcheting up of Russia's rhetoric, Medvedev said new Western sanctions were a sign of the West's impotence in the standoff and hinted at a severing of diplomatic ties, saying it was time to "padlock the embassies".

在俄羅斯最近日增的發言中，Medvedev指出西方的制裁反應了西方對目前對峙的無力，並且影射終止各種外交，宣稱是時候「關閉使館」了

After a night of airstrikes, there were some signs of panic in Kyiv. Reuters reporters saw Ukrainian soldiers and a group of women running along the street. Nearby, Ukrainian soldiers forced a man in civilian clothes to lie down on the pavement.

在一晚空襲之後，基輔可以觀察到一些混亂的跡象。路透社記者目擊了烏克蘭士兵與一群女士在街上奔走。而一旁烏克蘭士兵逼迫身穿民服的男子趴在路上。

Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said there was currently no major Russian military presence in Kyiv, but added that saboteur groups were active. The metro system is now serving only as a shelter for citizens and trains have stopped running, he said.

基輔市長 Vitali Klitschko 表示基輔目前仍未有俄軍進駐，但破壞行動則正在進行中。目前地鐵已經暫停營運並且作為避難所在使用。

Klitschko said 35 people, including two children, had been wounded overnight. He later announced the extension of a night-time curfew, which will now run from 5 pm until 8 am.

Klitschko 表示有 35 人，其中包含 2 名孩童在夜晚中受傷，並且在之後宣布宵禁將延長，所有人應該避免在晚間五點後與晨間八點前出門。

At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed and 1,115 people wounded so far in Russia's invasion, Interfax quoted Ukraine's Health Ministry as saying. It was unclear whether the numbers comprised only civilian casualties.

目前在俄羅斯的侵攻中至少 198 名烏克蘭人，其中包含 3 名孩童已被殺害，而傷患已來到 1115 人。目前無法確認這些數字是否包含士兵。

"We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on," Zelenskiy said in a video message posted on his social media. "We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe."

Zelenskiy在社交媒體的一則影片中表示「我們已站穩並成功阻擋敵軍的侵略，戰鬥仍在進行中。我們有捍衛家園的勇氣，有捍衛歐洲的勇氣」

Britain said the bulk of Russian forces were now 30 km (19 miles) from the centre of Kyiv and said Russia had yet to gain control of Ukraine's airspace.

英國表示大團俄羅斯軍力目前部署在距離基輔中心 30 公里處，並且正在空中取得優勢。

The Kremlin said Putin had ordered troops to stop advancing on Friday but that they were moving forwards on Saturday after Kyiv refused to negotiate. Both Moscow and Kyiv had previously raised the possibility of peace talks but they came to nothing.

克里姆林宮表示 Putin 已經在週五下令軍隊停止進軍，然而由於基輔拒絕談判，他們已經在週六繼續進軍。莫斯科與基輔雙方都曾提議談和，然而目前戰事仍在進行中

RESISTANCE

Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 and wants to join NATO and the EU, goals Russia opposes. Putin says Ukraine is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their distinctive history and identity.

烏克蘭是一個有著四千四百萬人民的民主共和國。烏克蘭於1991年獨立並且希望能加入歐盟與北約－而這些恰是俄羅斯所不樂見的。Putin表示烏克蘭嫖竊了俄羅斯的人民與土地，然而烏克蘭人認為這樣的觀點是在抹消烏克蘭自身的歷史與認同。

Western intelligence sources say Russian forces have encountered far stronger Ukrainian resistance to their invasion than they had expected to their invasion.

西方智庫烏克蘭對侵攻的反抗遠超出他們的預期

Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces had captured Melitopol, a city of 150,000 in southeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials were not immediately available to comment and Britain cast doubt on the report.

俄羅斯國防部表示他們已經攻下 Melitopol，一個烏克蘭東南有著十五萬人口的城市。目前沒有任何烏克蘭官方證實且英國對這個宣稱存疑

If confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre the Russians have seized.

如果這項宣稱屬實，這會是俄羅斯第一個佔領的人口重鎮。


Ukraine said more than 1,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. Russia did not release casualty figures.

烏克蘭宣稱超過 1000 名俄羅斯士兵已被殺害，另一方面，俄羅斯並沒有提供任何死傷數字。

Putin has said he must eliminate what he calls a serious threat to his country from its smaller neighbour and has cited the need to "denazify" Ukraine's leadership, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine - a charge dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies as baseless propaganda.

Putin 表示他必須根除來自鄰國對俄羅斯的重大威脅並且必續制止諸如烏克蘭在東烏克蘭針對俄羅斯發言人的種族滅絕的納粹主義。這項指控已被烏克蘭澄清且被烏克蘭的西方盟友認為是大內宣的一部分。

About 100,000 people have crossed into Poland from Ukraine since Thursday, including 9,000 who have entered since 7 a.m. on Saturday, Polish Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker told a news conference.

波蘭內政部副長 Pawel Szefernaker 在新聞會中表示自週四以來，已有超過十萬人跨越了烏克蘭國境進入波蘭，而這包含了在週六早上七點的九千人。

At Medyka in southern Poland, refugees described a 30-km (19-mile) line at the border. Ukrainians were also crossing the borders into Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

在南波蘭的 Medyka，難民在邊境綿延了 30 公里，其他烏克蘭難民前往的地區包括匈牙利、羅馬尼雅與斯洛伐克

"The most important thing is that people survive," said Katharina Asselborn, wiping away tears while waiting at the Polish border for her sister, aunt and her three children to arrive from their home in Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa.

Katharina Asselborn於波蘭邊境等待姐妹、阿姨與她的三個孩子時邊拭淚邊說著「最重要的是人民能夠存活。」


"The last 30 kilometres to the border they went on foot."

「到邊境前的最後三十公里都是徒步」

One woman, Nataliya Ableyeva, crossed into Hungary with two young children not her own and only the mobile phone number of their mother. Their father had not been allowed to cross the frontier due to a ban on all men aged 18 to 60 leaving Ukraine so they can fight for their country. read more

Ukraine has evacuated its embassy staff in Moscow to Latvia, the Baltic country's foreign ministry said on Saturday.

SANCTIONS

Western nations have announced a raft of sanctions on Russia, including blacklisting its banks and banning technology exports.

西方國家已對俄羅斯提出多項制裁，包括出口禁令與將銀行加入禁止名單

They have stopped short of forcing Russia out of the SWIFT system for international bank payments, but the governor of a central bank in the euro zone told Reuters on Saturday such a decision was "just a matter of time, very short time, days".

目前俄羅斯還能使用 SWIFT 系統進行國際銀行交易，然而一名歐元區中央銀行的負責人在週六表示這項禁止應該也會在數日內實施。

"Is it sufficient? No. Is it necessary? Absolutely. Sanctions only make sense if there are costs for both sides and this will be costly," the central banker said.

這名負責人表示「這樣夠嗎，不夠。那這有必要嗎？當然。制裁只有在對雙方都會造成不便的時候才有用，而這項制裁會造成極大的不便。」

Medvedev said Moscow would respond symmetrically to the seizure of money of Russian citizens and companies abroad by seizing the funds of foreigners in Russia.

Medvedev 表示莫斯科已反向地透過扣押在俄外籍人士資產反擊。

The United States has imposed sanctions on Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov. The EU and Britain earlier froze any assets Putin and Lavrov held in their territory.

美國以對 Putin 實施制裁，外務卿 Sergei Lavrov 與國防卿

The invasion is also affecting Russia's sports, cultural and other links. On Saturday Poland's Football Association, in protest, said the national team would not play its World Cup qualifier against Russia next month.

這項侵攻也影響了俄羅斯的運動文化與其他連結。波蘭足協已在週六表示將不會參加世界杯對上俄羅斯的預賽以示抗議。

Russia banned airlines from Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic from flying to and over its territory in response to similar moves by those countries. It has already banned all British airlines from its airspace.

俄羅斯已禁止來自波蘭、保加利雅以及捷克的班機航經或航向其領土。這項措施是針對這些國家對俄羅斯制裁的反向措施。目前俄羅斯也已經禁止任何英國班機。
