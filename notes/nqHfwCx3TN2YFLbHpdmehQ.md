*Below are rough ideas to be brianstormed and bought in together with the DAO and pod members.*

*Just some ideas to start:*

## Why
* Taiwan is the best place in the world to experiment and learn about Decentralized Society / DID because of our strong open source history success like g0v, forward thinking government, a place where values like freedom and democracy are important
* What we try and learn needs to be shared with the communities and thought leaders around the world interested in the same topics under different context, for awareness and resource/knowledge exchange.
* Our mission is to **Bridge da0 with relevant global web3 communities to import knowledge, build relationships, and export progress**

### How 

* Connect with global communities or leaders interested in DeSoc / DID experiments such as Glen Weyl (RxC), Balaji(Network States).
* Consistently export our learnings and progress 
* Build a online presence and subscription people can follow

### What

* English content on 
    * Learnings 
    * Progress
    * Opinions

* In the form of
    * Twitter

    * Memes

### Who 

* Pod leads - share progress from your pod
* Content writer - organize content and share in easily digestable format
* Translator - translate from Mandarin to English 
* Designer - Create visuals or memes 
* Social Media Manager - Help maintain twitter account 

### Open Questions
