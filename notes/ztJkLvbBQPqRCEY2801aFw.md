Are modern slots designed to exhaust players

It does sometimes feel like slots are designed to keep you spinning endlessly, especially the new ones with flashy features. From my experience on [1xbet casino cameroon games](https://1-x-bet-cameroon.com/casino), the best way is to mix shorter sessions with small goals. I try not to chase every spin and instead enjoy the game casually. Taking a step back and just watching patterns can be surprisingly entertaining. Over time, I’ve realized that pacing yourself makes the whole experience less tiring and more fun.
