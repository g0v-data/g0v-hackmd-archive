# Re-inventing Democracy - Taiwan Visit

> [點此觀看原始內容](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/VMj8jxiMTx8)


Dear friends,

My name is José from Australia. I have a video blog called re-inventing democrary, which documents transformation in governance and democracy from around the world - [http://reinventingdemocracy.org](http://reinventingdemocracy.org)  I am also just begining to write a book on transformations of democracy and governance from around the world.

I learned about what is happening in Taiwan through people like Dennis Bartlett (loomio) and articles onthe web, and also my friend Allen Lin who I live with in Melbourne.

I am visiting Taipei from the 7th November to the 13th November, and I am hoping to meet people from g0v and also to interview people for my video blog  and for the book project.

I am hoping someone can connect me with people willing to have some conversations and also to do video interviews. I would greatly appreciate any connections.

Thanks so much!

José Ramos
