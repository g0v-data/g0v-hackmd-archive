# Gov Data Opener / TW

PPT: https://reurl.cc/Gkm4XW

We are a team of Taiwanese activists and computer engineers who would like to see a more open and transparent government. It is the time when the openness and transparency of the government, especially represented in the availability of the data it collects, can most effectively help engage its citizens to understand and participate in the government's policy and decision-making process. 

First, we will find helpers and analyse and tag all the FOI requests including those made through public platforms and lawsuit cases and figure out the key factors why so many FOI requests have been rejected. 

Second, we will hold workshops and bring together individuals and organisations who have related experiences to review the results of our analysis and come up with useful tips and tricks on how to request government information successfully. 

Third, we will create an informational website that displays how each public sector responds to FOI requests and a FOI guiding tool with tips and examples for people who failed get a successful outcome in their requests and for those who are just about to make first attempts.
