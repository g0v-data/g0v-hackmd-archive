In Dubai's climate where the mercury often climbs above 40°C, a small chip in your windscreen can grow rapidly. Heat stress, along with air pressure and rough roads, can turn a minor issue into a big safety risk, potentially requiring windshield replacement.

Damaged autoglass limits your view, weakens your car's structure, and might even lead to penalties under UAE traffic rules. This means fixing your cracked windshield isn't just a smart move---it's required by law.
