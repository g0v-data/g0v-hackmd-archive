00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,666
\[BLANK_AUDIO\]

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,638
\[INAUDIBLE\] I wanted to answer by yourself please.

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,638
>\> I know Taiwan

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,072
\[LAUGH\]

5
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:13,967
Okay so yes my name is Yantisa Hadi,

6
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:14,045
you

7
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:20,164
can call me Ian, that's easier to pronounce \[INAUDIBLE\] yeah.

8
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:24,158
You might stop with the point of For them it's a bit hard to how

9
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:26,053
sure they call me I just call me,

10
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:28,101
Ian that's three letter that's

11
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:31,992
easy that you still you might in fact call me Indonesia.

12
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:36,165
So I'm currently the project manager of the humanitarian open \[INAUDIBLE\]

13
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,086
in Indonesia.

14
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:45,364
What we'll state is how to use open state up data in the humanitarian

15
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:47,130
as well as in the economic development.

16
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:51,048
So in Indonesia we've been involved in the National Disaster Management

17
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:55,454
Agency on how to use \[UNKNOWN\] into disaster management.

18
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,144
In the previous cases start from emergency to response,

19
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,489
\[UNKNOWN\]

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,104
construction as per

21
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,003
Thorax/g and the great back/g plus intra-fracture.

22
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:04,260
>\> Yes.

23
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,797
Thank you.

24
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:11,890
>\> So what may be the turn out government people stop mapping out

25
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,300
all this in?

26
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:19,879
>\> It start in 2012 so it's really interesting and I think is this

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,591
also the starting of That I would talk in the Gov Summit how Jakarta

28
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:27,738
government initially have difficulties in having the spatial data

29
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,559
because Jakarta is very dense,

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,526
it's very urban and it's not to

31
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,887
get a very good map.

32
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:39,316
They came with the other platform such as Google Map or Bing Map

33
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:46,612
does not have detail There are 260 village in Jakarta and that's

34
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:50,504
like the not the small but of at main \[INAUDIBLE\].

35
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:57,849
Their are \[INAUDIBLE\] and there are some in the bottom 12 we've

36
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,849
managed to make

37
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,378
All the staff village in these 267 village so in total it is about

38
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,606
several thousand staff village,

39
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:11,627
boundary and the map so people

40
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:20,843
know I live in this \[INAUDIBLE\] to get that information something.

41
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:27,114
Even if it's available it's only up until down to \[INAUDIBLE\] level,

42
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:31,365
not below that.

43
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:36,971
>\> So in that case does it take a lot of effort to convince them

44
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:41,681
to actually use \[INAUDIBLE\] or they sometimes.

45
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,857
They should build their own map right after you convince them.

46
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,726
Which is the right way to go?

47
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:52,486
>\> Well I think the first thing that fully convince them because

48
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:55,661
it did not cost a lot's of money.

49
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:59,849
In a city like Jakarta it will cost a lot to.

50
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,073
Like the star fish all the \[INAUDIBLE\] why I'm saying it's free

51
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:07,889
the \[INAUDIBLE\] did not need to provide supper.

52
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,217
They did not need like to provide deploy like time of \[INAUDIBLE\]

53
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:16,417
of Jakarta that can last to like one or two years.

54
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:20,565
Too have it all mapped.

55
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,665
It will last then three months.

56
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:28,479
Always possible because we invite all of the village \[INAUDIBLE\]

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,037
to come to city hall and then they are assisted by one geography

58
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:36,828
student from the university of Indonesian.

59
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,132
So it's student it's actually through word in the mapping.

60
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:45,585
And \[INAUDIBLE\] So you need to make,

61
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:49,961
when there's \[INAUDIBLE\] or

62
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,290
so there's a stadium/g here,

63
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,469
village office here, and there's a

64
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,953
hospital, there's the clinic.

65
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,849
So they're the one who they have the information and then \[INAUDIBLE\]

66
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,413
Who do the mapping.

67
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:09,707
So all the process can be written in the large system \[UNKNOWN\]

68
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,882
I''ll play the video on how it goes.

69
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,141
Not the whole video,

70
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:15,877
it won't be boring, I promise.

71
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:19,871
It will be less than five minutes about the process and how to In

72
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:26,757
Jakarta, sub-village able to be mapped and all the important information

73
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:32,364
that will be very useful during plots can be accessible by all.

74
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,311
\[BLANK_AUDIO\]

75
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,051
So,

76
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:40,889
\[BLANK_AUDIO\]

77
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,144
One of the greatest use of OS is

78
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:48,133
obviously the augmentarian open street map team that you're involved

79
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:52,767
with, which is usually activated after disaster,

80
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:55,148
so do you think

81
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:59,849
the mapping helps from like abandoned people around the world?

82
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:07,142
Actually helps in the relief or rescue after a disaster happened

83
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:09,062
from your experience

84
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:13,621
>\> Yes I believe so because now open statement

85
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,872
is not only used in humanitarian setting,

86
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:18,969
it can also be used for

87
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:25,192
first where You use OSN like tourist using \[UNKOWN\] so somehow

88
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:29,954
using open statement data because you can use the outline map,

89
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,792
so if it helps people who come to the Chopaka but they are not

90
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:37,041
familiar with Chopaka so they need to access a map.

91
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:40,880
Google map might be able to help you then but in OSN The information

92
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:45,820
is richer because one you can access it offline,

93
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:46,356
you don't need

94
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:53,216
to buy the data like data subscribe when you're in Indonesia you

95
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:58,056
can access the data then during disaster you can browse through

96
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,849
the map without the need of Internet

97
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,151
Internet connection,

98
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,759
it's offline map you can, like in the rare

99
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,104
plantation in the corner of Peru,

100
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:10,024
take this even other than choice,

101
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:13,960
the government now also uses YSM data and now they take you on

102
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:15,140
a tool called Jacksafe/g,

103
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,209
so Jacksafe/g is the tool that can be

104
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,295
used if floods happen in Jakarta The estimate like the impact of

105
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:28,489
the floods and what is the cost and the damage and loss of that

106
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,283
floods.

107
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:34,083
And what is the cost for example we get the hospital in Indonesia

108
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,596
for about three days for example.

109
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:37,996
What is the cost for that one?

110
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,164
So then the estimation the impact of the cost The impact of the

111
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:46,060
floods and they can give you like the cost of the impact.

112
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,846
\[BLANK_AUDIO\]

113
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:53,014
>\> So this is what you were saying about estimating

114
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:59,849
the flood cost is sort of what happens like what

115
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,765
My question was actually after there was a disaster like

116
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:04,179
>\> Yup!

117
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,995
>>The earthquake.

118
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:10,733
usually, there are people around the world trying to help the actual

119
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:16,265
team pump along and do you think the data they provide actually

120
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:22,437
helps those that are doing the rescue and Relief work?

121
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:29,195
>\> Yea we believe so because if you're going to one of the main

122
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:35,009
parts during disaster or the emergency response first time you

123
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,595
need to understand the gap and where is the override because usually

124
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,586
when people People try to help one location there are too many

125
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,989
people active in that area so that's override there are too many

126
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,112
actions from different government organisation coming to the area

127
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:53,985
but we see that as also a gap,

128
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:56,366
where there's an area where no one

129
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,467
comes to that area although that area might be in the data for

130
00:07:59,468 --> 00:07:59,849
like five

131
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,433
Five meters but because no media there no one told them what happens

132
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:07,456
then you'll be program/g to that area,

133
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,798
so to do this we need to

134
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:14,502
have a group of \[UNKNOWN\] that enter to display where are the operas/g

135
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:16,591
where there are too many actors and we are the guest/g,

136
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:16,952
but there

137
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:20,187
are no one respond to that area probably because it's hard to get

138
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:24,987
Not there or probably because no one know that it is actually in

139
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:28,203
the data because the one who do the report is people living in

140
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:31,850
the area, so they are the one who understand that okay this is

141
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:34,518
not happening in my area/g but no one come here.

142
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,502
So that be informed through the map so that people know oh so that

143
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:43,398
area is still \[UNKNOWN\] meaning that It's quite milder.

144
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,286
The prop level and we need more people coming to the area and keeping

145
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:52,038
the resistance in terms of logistics in terms of roads to be able

146
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,819
to reach the area so that people can be evacuated from the area.

147
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,458
\[BLANK_AUDIO\]

148
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:58,255
>\> Excellent.

149
00:08:58,256 --> 00:08:59,849
So besides mapping and

150
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,077
And an actual.

151
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:08,664
Do you think the global city type community who are making technology

152
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:13,224
for social good or democracy,

153
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,514
do you think they are actually bringing

154
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:18,114
impacts that you can see?

155
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:19,596
>\> Yes, definitely.

156
00:09:19,597 --> 00:09:26,076
Now we are \[INAUDIBLE\] compared to \[INAUDIBLE\] years ago.

157
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:33,324
And now I see the difference from \[INAUDIBLE\] is that now we see

158
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:35,436
that corporates start to join hand.

159
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:40,422
So the global texting okay so there are already actors/g They already

160
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,054
got \[INAUDIBLE\].

161
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:47,526
There are more may be like open day star people they are open \[INAUDIBLE\]

162
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:50,024
the one that makes and application.

163
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:55,158
So the corporate thing is I think it's time that we should jump

164
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,849
in especially like in Indonesia now it is mandatory.

165
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:06,401
Corporate social responsibility program where they can also gel

166
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:12,112
in and make an effort on how to help in those condition.

167
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:15,328
Because other than the big corporate is also a victim.

168
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,449
Their property is also damaged by the floods for example.

169
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,537
But we'll set capacity One of the big state oil companies actually

170
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:29,536
have group like a \[UNKNOWN\] that might be useful \[UNKNOWN\].

171
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:31,551
So they may \[INAUDIBLE\].

172
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,575
Especially now into disaster management.

173
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:35,705
Disaster is everybody's business,

174
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:39,305
not \[INAUDIBLE\] governmental.

175
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:47,490
Like the only The resources but civil society we as \[INAUDIBLE\]

176
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:49,508
may also help in this effort.

177
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:53,826
And so the corporate would likely jump in and see that since the

178
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:57,234
global \[INAUDIBLE\] now kind of a grouping now.

179
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,849
There are contracts/g now such as the Gov Summit

180
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,205
Experiences and how you can replicate the common/g countries.

181
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:10,869
So we saw that \[INAUDIBLE\] they're trying to be involved in it.

182
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,313
And not necessarily as a competition but as a polite \[INAUDIBLE\]

183
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:19,103
effort dealing with the disasters.

184
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:25,179
>\> Right so Can you tell me what do before it and how do you get

185
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,006
into a \[UNKNOWN\] attack.

186
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,406
Say out.

187
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,914
How you start-

188
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:36,057
>>Yeah, so this a quite interesting story because

189
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,218
when I was graduated from my bachelor degree,

190
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,295
it was the right

191
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:39,876
moment.

192
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:43,669
When there are people Our big earthquake happen in my university.

193
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,524
So it's 6.3 Richter scale earthquake and 5,000

194
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:50,581
people died during

195
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,596
the defense.

196
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:53,680
And more than 300,000

197
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,310
building is destroyed.

198
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:59,849
That's happening when it is my interrogation ceremony in university.

199
00:11:59,850 --> 00:11:59,849
So, probably that's

200
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,881
Just kind of my call.

201
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:08,466
Okay, probably I'm trying to help with everything that I have.

202
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:14,898
\[INAUDIBLE\] from there I can help in data management,

203
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,378
in information

204
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:16,004
management.

205
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:19,122
That's why shortly after I graduated,

206
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:20,306
I was recruited in the The

207
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,809
pleasure of the presence of the Red Cross and Red Crescent society.

208
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,561
So I have the management of Share distribution during earthquakes

209
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:32,930
so like when the shares are distributed by which organisation,

210
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:34,239
where are the tents,

211
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,830
where are the operable lines and which organisation

212
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:40,095
is there with regards to the disaster,

213
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:41,679
place and And then they

214
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,887
can see that okay I have 100 shelter,

215
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,327
when can I give it?

216
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,295
So we give them the math,

217
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:49,455
we give them the data \[INAUDIBLE AUDIO\]

218
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:52,143
There are still people needs shelter.

219
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:57,711
So moving forward I was joined with United Nations Development Program.

220
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:59,849
Again they are the one responsible for

221
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,677
The property and rehabilitation of actual doswick/g might help people

222
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,885
with more livelihood.

223
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,757
Help the company rebuild their business,

224
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,533
rebuild small and medium

225
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:16,004
enterprises so first go over now I'm joining \[INAUDIBLE AUDIO\]

226
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,698
with their teams.

227
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,226
still in the disaster management.

228
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:23,929
So yeah I think How I really get into central bank.

229
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,689
So one of the big gap in the humanitarian world is that there is

230
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,089
not much innovation comparing to the industry,

231
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,769
comparing to the

232
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,034
other sector where you see innovation going on even if you're not

233
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,954
innovated, you'll die.

234
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:42,602
I mean you'll be perish/g Will not survive but in the humanitarian

235
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:47,066
because well people just okay this humanitarian cause I will pour

236
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:51,242
money \[INAUDIBLE AUDIO\] But it is relevant that people moving fast

237
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:55,370
in terms of taking the technology.

238
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:58,394
It's not really something that's high-tech/g.

239
00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,849
So I think there's lots

240
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:06,589
That can improved in this humanitarian world how this technology

241
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,349
might able to help through this disaster depend on how high-tech

242
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,885
can really help.

243
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,477
Because people might even see how they can help,

244
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:17,533
especially during

245
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:22,669
disaster \[INAUDIBLE AUDIO\] Electricity down and It's hard to get

246
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,181
in that connection.

247
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:28,405
But I think there are various other possible technologies that can

248
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:33,685
be employed such as peer-to-peer networking such as cheap satellite

249
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,460
connection possibly.

250
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:43,141
So yeah I think there are sector that we can Improve in that sentence.

251
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:45,733
>\> That's great.

252
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:48,177
So may be the last one.

253
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,513
Did you see our agenda yet?

254
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:55,385
Says what station you know summit would you sounds most interesting

255
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:59,849
to you and what kind of people you'd like to meet in Taiwan.

256
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,685
I think all of them is interesting that's why I am keen to join

257
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,557
from the first day.

258
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:15,421
I try to watch as many sessions as possible because in the humanitarian

259
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:17,532
world needs to take lesson from other sector.

260
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:21,181
How I see the developers of innovation has been In the region are

261
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:24,925
now \[INAUDIBLE AUDIO\] and I see that I were this also a good place

262
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:29,149
to do that because comparing we join a civic bank like civic bank

263
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,613
gathering for a \[INAUDIBLE AUDIO\].

264
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:37,261
Euro for example, but they have different culture.

265
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:40,333
But in Asia they have similar culture and how.

266
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:44,557
So I think the ratification of the success story is much more possible

267
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,813
comparing to hear something from the US.

268
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:50,220
But from different culture or something from Europe but again from

269
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:50,957
the \[INAUDIBLE AUDIO\] culture.

270
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,948
Buy on Asia we are in more of a similar culture some people might

271
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:59,849
say eastern culture then it's having more.

272
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:06,071
Probability for being replicated and also implemented so I'm really

273
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:10,603
keen on seeing innovation and other sector and possibly we can

274
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:14,877
break that in the humanitarian world.

275
00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:21,765
>\> Thank you Taiwan as you know Taiwan is a more.

276
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:26,582
We have earthquake, iPhone /g and other things we are very looking

277
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,683
forward to having you here.

278
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:32,601
maybe three weeks not later.

279
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:36,369
>\> Yeah okay while I'm really looking forward for the event.

280
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,081
>\> Okay thank you let me get also

281
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:45,000
>\> \[INAUDIBLE\]

Hi, so she's on here now. Nice to meet you.

Hello so  please tell us about yourself, what you do before and how did you get here,
s'il vous plaît. Ok so I'm Charlotte, I'm one of our co-founders I'm 31, I graduated from "alburn?" and we founded "" in 2012 for the next presidential election in France and I'm really happy to meet you guys in like one month.

5
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:50,039
to meet you guys in like one once so its
newest global see what a community you

6
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:58,809
actually bringing in your opinion maybe
even just introduced to be bugs that are

7
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:05,950
explained myself but we created books
that are you backing to actually where

8
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,438
young people and all the young people in
France then we're not really interested

9
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:21,840
in politics and there were no state for
that selection and all he did was sit

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:34,459
around and he was Nicolas Sarkozy and so
we decided to create a sequel and the

11
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:47,019
aim was to you and what we did you know
when they will be elected chill back

12
00:01:47,019 --> 00:02:05,079
there was no easier and I think we will
be the key to what we all do next year

13
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:15,569
it's difficult I will have we already
have 40 countries in 2.5 million euros

14
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:38,090
users but will be we want you reduce use
absolution could 10% so you started

15
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:46,209
bucks and 2012 so I see a lot of what
you say about fifteen countries that joy

16
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:56,319
and choose uses for their comparing
candidates in elections right so which

17
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,169
countries had the elections and and I
like how many people are the scale to

18
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:14,090
users for election in their country
we've reached something like 3.5 million

19
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:25,199
users and she lost countries are united
states regulate 1 months ago and just

20
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,120
launched another country which is which
the first round of the presidential

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:42,199
election was a few weeks ago and on the
way we are on our way of saying yes is

22
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:54,050
there and every time we open source
literature tease everyone can use the

23
00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:01,419
platform and used the website and we
build communities in every country they

24
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,509
just want to use drugs that are really
out there

25
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:19,370
yeah I see they are you can now compared
to many days in the us- and so like of

26
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:27,149
perspective such as enemies or education
is this so so who will create a scene

27
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:34,380
there are like the source to the shop
and so you get the community to

28
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:44,319
contribute June that he has closed its
petals indication yes replied nerds

29
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,100
repugnant meet the Tempest which is a
medium blogs and they're really great

30
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:58,199
job of copy and paste the program so
it's official and neutral

31
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:13,728
everyone can submit yeah by source for
sale that's not what I was doing last

32
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:22,690
imperial defended its actual I thought I
don't know or care media stay but you

33
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:35,899
just actually controlled by a while so I
think that's that's really cool and we

34
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:42,810
should know this year so we can
collaborate this I would love that

35
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,689
definitely so

36
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:57,379
so like I think from the website is
pledging not just to be a election I see

37
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:06,889
there are no what's right and you do
that yeah we just launched recently

38
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,798
newsletter which is cool

39
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:16,360
democracy effective Dec backing the only
one in the city takes you learn from

40
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:27,360
their many really creates things
happening on this to be take since no

41
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,309
one knows about its we like benches
hundred people who are interesting in

42
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:41,009
that field and news about the great to
public doesn't have a clue but what's

43
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:48,098
happening so we just decided to create
the vision is to me do take media in

44
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:56,288
Europe and you just being crazy we begin
with the newsletter and the EDS to bring

45
00:06:56,288 --> 00:07:06,738
back Lee even around this city kicks in
Europe should degrade the public so they

46
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:14,839
could go into the even happening in
Paris right now

47
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:33,779
ok so just one month and a half ago and
we are like most users so in the end the

48
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:44,408
moment will say if you want a sign that
you have to be democracy it's a French

49
00:07:44,408 --> 00:08:00,899
or English we gonna try two or three
months or so see

50
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:07,019
attacking the future in your opinion is
that doable as if it's like really

51
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:23,348
brings back to government everywhere I
am making a difference first between

52
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:27,380
which are really different to me

53
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:41,860
biggest challenge will be funding to be
independence and that's why we always we

54
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:56,159
just won the challenge so we are like
really thats because we we're coming

55
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,539
we're having the biggest challenge will
be funding to keep our independence and

56
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:11,250
choose what we're doing now because I
really believe in the business model are

57
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:22,558
all our initiative but it has to be
Burgess you know we think about long

58
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:30,078
time of what we can do all the data we
are and we did and we decided that we

59
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:37,659
will never sell it because it would be
like a reason for other uses in its not

60
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:48,009
as I really believe we have to find so
we have to find business what else so

61
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,678
that our initiatives

62
00:09:51,678 --> 00:10:07,759
lost to come and they also suggest an
independent yeah

63
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,409
that's it and I think the other
challenge is to address the greater
