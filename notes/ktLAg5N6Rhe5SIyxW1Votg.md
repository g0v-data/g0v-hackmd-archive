### Dinner with delegation & Anna
Liberals are usually young, what about conservatives?
Some. A MP on Wednesday is an example.

Panels were planned to have people of very different positions.

Referendums in Switzerland. A two-page booklet on every issue. Enough? If you live in Switzerland, it’s hard to avoid all the information, debates... Some topics are rational debates, some could be emotional - Immigration is an example.

“Operation Libero” - an org that work with different parties to design good content for young voters on social media; self-identified as liberals, at least 2 liberal parties in Switzerland, some issue have own agenda. OL is supported with crowdfunding. Had big donation in last election but most are small donations.

Sunflower & HK movement - different perspectives and connection between the two movements

No face-to-face meeting.

How many people are in g0v?
- jothon, intl
- bi-monthly hackathons ~100 ppl
- regular meetings of some projects

ROC and Taiwan
Two kinds of unifications - by PRC / by ROC
Two kinds of independence - by ROC / by Taiwan

Fall of the wall - Unification? Freedom & Democracy?
- Meeting with people on the other side
- Freedom to go to America

Bursting the bubble
- Democracy is not about a single person

After unification, many Easterners expected job & car in 5 years, did not happen. Frustration and anger can be leveraged.

### Audrey talk & QA
- Talk - [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvSvBN2drxw)
- QA session:
    - It is fine to manipulate - in accountable way. So each meeting with @au will put the video online in 10 days. In that way we make sure the accountability by public review.
    - Satistic shows that major two parts of age in collaborative-meeting are 15 and 65. One theory of that might be whose two groups have more avalible time and also care about will being of next generation.

### Workshop 1 - Civic Tech - Citizen Participation

- Moderator: explains fishbowl format and there will be camera and recordings and you can ask not to be recording at anytime to the participants.  There are drinks.  Relax.  We have 90 minutes.
- C: CPC (citizen's press conferenc) from HK holds press conferences to counter what HK gov and police says.  They are voluntary.  Please don't photo them.  To evade gov tracing, protestors use Telegram.  Gov uses lamp posts for surveilances and protests sometimes destroy them.  Protests use cash.
- Y: Contributor to this community called g0v.  Me and P and I cofounded g0v-intl to facilitate intl exchange.  Also choulin is here.  g0v started in 2012.  At the time gov ran an ad.  A group people got angry and decided that instead of protests they will show the gov how it could be better.  Made visualization of budgets to counter the argument that gov is too complicated to understand.  Used bubble teas to make it fun.  Being fun is important.  Voting guide was built for people to vote more informed.  Project about public properties in TW.  It became a gov web site of Taipei City where you can apply to use that property.  Mis/disinfo and fact checking projects recently.  A crowdsourced chatbot to help fact checking called cofacts.  Also disinfo research group.  Approach the problem with transparency and openness.  Produce open datasets on this issue.  Some projects.  All open source.  Community holds bi-monthly hackathon so if you are in TW you are welcomed.
- F from Senegal: Runnig innovation spaces in Africa.  Using new technology we can more.  Festival to promote using civictech.  People don't know which and where are the civictech tools built.  We are founded by the foundation to build an app to show people what is civictech.  Building communities in Senegal around each of the projects.  Civictechs are not only in the big catipals.  Going to villages to let them know you are already doing civitech.  Senegal history.  In 21 June 2012 we had the biggest strike ever.  It was lead by a group called ..., because the gov has no transparency.  To let the gov know participantion and citizenship should be part of the development of the country.
- S: director of CityLab in Berlin.  Also teaching in Univ about data.  We actually got a lot of inspirations from g0v projects.  I think we are operating on a different level from what you are doing because we are safe.  It is not only about tools.  You also need physical platforms for people to work and exchange ideas and use the whole infrastructure for free.
- F: also working on coworking spaces.
- N: Berlin should just require putting airboxes on construction sites, or put birdboxes.  Make things that people can feel that is important.
- C: Berlin has really bad internet connection right? (everyone laughs)
- N: internet access.  having access is the basic things to all these new ways of participation.  there is still a long way to go.
- C: we all improve when there is a crisis.  this is unfortunate.  but I would like to say that you don't have to wait for a crisis to start improving things.
- ?: curious about how do you engage elderlies and those who do not use smartphone.
- Y: before that I would like to say that technology does not have to be 3C products.  A notebook and pen is a technology.  Engineerers build tools.  But that's not enough.  To get the full picture, for example, my job is to use the datasets to make public understand.  Another example is MyGoPen.  Senior people don't know about it.  BTW a lot of elderly people are good at smartphones.  There is a group of people called fake news out.  they would go to mountain trackes where older people appears.  they would say "hey do you know this?  do you know this is fake?"  they would introduce this linebot to the old people.  so it's like this.  engineers build bots.  real people, activists connect with people.
- N: that takes trust and rebuild connection.
- Y: so the education project I know are working on this kind of work.  I would like to highlight that they are not part of g0v community but are doing very important work there.
- ?: for me milk-sasuage cancer I would run away.  is it a culture thing?  how do you make people wait and not cringe when you talk about milk-sausage cancer is fake news?
- Y: actually I have no tip on that.  just face-to-face interactions.
- C: use infographics with "good morning" and phrases used by elderlies.
- N: fake news.  climate crisis.  the concept of facts and fact checking doesn't work as we expected.  what can we do?
- Y: yeah I agree.  I personally don't believe fact checking works because by fact checking you are also seminating the lies.
- L: I want to response to how to delivery civictech to the society.  I join g0v as a normal citizen.  I my opinion g0v is a special group of people in TW society.  there are two major parties in TW.  g0v actually only covers one half of that because I have never met a g0ver agree with the other party.  The reason that g0v developed so well in TW is because of our special environment.  every country have their own environment.  we are a country good at communication industry.  for internet connection in berlin TW people would get angry.  I would say that it would be very difficult for you if you follow our approach.  like DE, in TW if we mention DE in TW we think about Industry 4.0 and IoT.  Same thing.  I am opinion you should find your way to develop your civictech.  You care about privacy a lot here.  that is the start of civitech.  you can build technology but also retain your traditional ways to handle things.
- M: this is almost the perfect final statement, that there is not a single way and solution to put upon all of us.  recap.

### Workshop 2 - Populism

* Gave up fishbowl right away
* National Unity Blue and White
* Save Romania Union

### Workshop 3 - Good governance

### Workshop 4 - Open Data and Open Source as Enablers of Innovation
- Ray: 60 language in India, is it important to make sure everybody's. Voice can be found and communte with.
- Blerina: First work is education open data ideas to gov. The group's start since 2014. Teaching gov to know how to store data and teaching people how to securely give out thier data. Recently, the group being called open dataism. (LOL)
- Kalle: Hardware part of internet connection. EU and a company founded by NGO helped to build fiber connection. Identity use blockchain to make sure data is solid since 2012. gov have data of taxi service and then gov send it to uber and ask for info of driver and expect price. That so everything is preload and make taxing more eazier. Almost each Open data infrans run by gov.
- tmonk: How to convince gov to gradually change system to open source?
- Blerina: Make sure they are use same standard data scheme. 
- Kalle: Keep it safe and simple. Dandbox way to safely test the new idea. Right now, we have consulted lot of country of our blockchain system.It is 2% of our GDP.
- Kalle: About the diversity of gender join tech. There is a study shows that a girl learning preform better if there is no many boys around.
- Ray: (On Edu aspect) Critical thinking is the most important skill in this time.

### Panel - Do Parties Have to Reinvent Themselves
* Panelists
    * Laura-Kristine Krause, [More in Common](https://www.moreincommon.com/our-work/what-we-do/)
    * Laura Zimmermann, Operation Libero
    * Philipp Amthor MdB
    * Konstantin Kuhle MdB
* Moderator: Philipp will be a little bit late.  Konstantin is a lawyer and member of FDP.  Laura is a lawyer and copresident of Operation Libero.  Laura-Kristine works in Berlin thinkbank.
* LK: Oct 2014 published a report on social cohesion(?).  We tried to understand why democracy does not look as stable as before.  Focus groups and many.  We used to take people by their ages and social economic situation.  This does not work.  So we group people by their interactions with the society.  There is a invisible third group that says they are lonesome. We traditionally think young generations are more liberal but actually the invisible third group consists of people around 28.  So old classifications do not work. 
* L: OL is a political group.  We see in SW paties have problems being popular.  We do not have the problem.  We can put contents of political discussions to social media.  It is not that OL wants to subsitutes any political parties.  We are here to point to the problems.  We cannot substitute the institutions of parties.  We are trying to change the political landscape by making parties more popular, although popular is sometime we can discuss later.  The invisible third we do not know what third it is but we do have that too.
* K: Young liberals.  To join a party you have a lot of processes, fill a form, etc.  Many people also do not know parties are associations.  Few people know they can be member of a political party.  The role of political parties is defined in constitution.  Parties are to forge a political future for people.  They are doing that for a little part of the people.
* LK: Many people do political work but not in a political party.  Parties are depend on maybe continuous engagements and involvement.
* L: I was not a founder of OL in Paris at the time.  But one of the founder was thinking about the same thing, which is lack of political home, high threshold for joining, etc.  We have put into the center from the begining is the button of participation(?)  People will and want to do something for a specific topic.  For example same-sex marriage.  Those people can just for that motivation be active.
* P: My constituancy is a bit blurr.  I think it is important to show that you take root in this place.  It is a mix, a good reflection of the society.  Digital works can supplement party work but it cannot replace party works.
* K: It is important to involve people in party work.  Which is speed and project work.  Also digitization.  A rough guess is that over 15% of the member cannot be reached by email.  I would like to see ditigalization but not after when we wait for the last person to discover what an email is but implement solutions that works for both kinds of people.
* L: why don't we let digital natives explain how digital tools work?
* P: Twitter is not popular in Germany. They are so many social media options. I found it exhausted to manage such many platforms.
* ...
* Moderator: Taiwan has this Presidential Hackathon
* L: SPD did a hackathon once, ideas came out, but it was not binding
* P: I love the idea. ... I can’t imagine to engage with people without knowing them first. ...
* LK: It sounds like youre saying digital tools are going to be the winning tools to bring the young to come shop in your party supermaket. I'm ambivalent of that.
* 討論是否應該用社交媒體、娛樂化的方式推動政治參與？
