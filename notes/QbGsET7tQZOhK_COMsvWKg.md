# Civic hacking (civic tech) contributors in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan

## Intro
Since 2019, FtO (Facing the Ocean) has been connecting civic hackers (civic tech contributors) in East Asia (West Pacific).

After more than 2 years of not being able to meet face to face, how is everyone doing?

This project wants to learn more about current (and past) civic hacking (civic tech) contributors in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and help people in different countries to learn more about each other :)
