- decidim 
    - depends on how cities want to use, normally for collecting opinions of specific policies (ex: kids want to have a skate park, draft of small city policy) -> city will have a offical discussion (local level), organize by emails(easy for people to speak out)
    - 15 local governments and private sectors
    - workshops for university or high school students

other tools used: not used yet in cfj, want to share other solutions in japan
- polipoli (not open source)
- Liquid by [Liquitous](https://liquitous.com/) (civic participation platform)

When using digital tools, what's your main considerations?
- Open source (not necessary, but important)
- maybe small town can do it, and help improve the company product
- easier UI, actually dicidim has poor user interface, we are getting better
- usability, not only using internet, also need to arrange offline conversations, such as workshops
- need to reach out to important stakeholders, who may affect blockchain decision making

If you can develop a civil tech tool, what would you like to achieve?
- better API, beside website, the API can also connect to social media

- People can creative some policy proposal in EU, we want to gradually process to this stage

what is the process of the workshop?

- operate to the young generation
- also open to elder generation that don't have some many resource in this aspect

Do you share the same issue or proceed with the same way?

- When we share with students, we share the local case, more creative sharing
- When elder, we don't use many digital tools, rather use a big white paper. We then convert the information into digital tools.
- We do civil participation voluntarily, not paying

Is there any project proceed with the dicidim.
