### **Market Segmentation by Type**

The liquid ring compressors market can be segmented by type into **single-stage**and **two-stage** systems, both offering distinct advantages based on operational requirements.

l **Single-stage Compressors**\
Single-stage liquid ring compressors are designed for applications where moderate vacuum levels or compression ratios are required. These compressors offer simple operation, lower costs, and are commonly used in industries like water treatment, pharmaceuticals, and food manufacturing. They provide sufficient power and performance in low to moderate pressure applications while maintaining high reliability.

l **Two-stage Compressors**\
Two-stage liquid ring compressors are better suited for applications requiring higher vacuum levels or higher compression ratios. They are widely used in more demanding industries such as petrochemical, oil and gas, and power generation. Two-stage compressors provide higher efficiency and improved performance, making them the ideal choice for processes that involve more complex or large-scale operations. The ability to handle larger volumes of gas makes them an essential component in industries where continuous, efficient operation is critical.

### **Market Segmentation by Material Type**

The liquid ring compressors market can also be categorized by the material type used for the compressor's construction, with **cast iron**, **stainless steel**, and **other materials** being the primary options.

l **Cast Iron**\
Compressors made from cast iron are widely used in standard industrial applications. Cast iron offers a balance between durability, cost-effectiveness, and performance. It is well-suited for applications that do not involve corrosive gases or fluids, making it a popular choice in industries like automotive and pulp & paper manufacturing.

l **Stainless Steel**\
For industries dealing with corrosive materials or requiring strict hygienic standards, stainless steel liquid ring compressors are the preferred option. These compressors are commonly used in petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and food processing industries, where durability and resistance to chemical exposure are vital. The stainless steel construction offers a higher level of resistance to corrosion, making these compressors ideal for harsh environments.

l **Others**\
In addition to cast iron and stainless steel, other materials such as bronze and composite materials are used in specialized applications that require enhanced performance. These materials are employed where there is a specific need for corrosion resistance or lightweight components in certain sectors like EPS and plastics manufacturing.

### **Market Segmentation by Flow Rate**

Liquid ring compressors are also segmented by **flow rate** capacity, depending on the industrial application and the volume of gas that needs to be compressed. The market is classified into:

l **25 -- 600 m³/h**\
Compressors with a flow rate between 25 and 600 m³/h are generally used in smaller-scale applications, such as in the pharmaceutical and food manufacturing industries. These compressors are well-suited for applications requiring precise control over small volumes of gas in processes that require moderate flow rates.

l **600 -- 3,000 m³/h**\
These mid-range flow compressors are utilized in industries like automotive, water treatment, and small to medium-sized chemical processing plants. They strike a balance between performance and operational cost, making them ideal for medium-capacity industrial needs.

l **3,000 -- 12,000 m³/h**\
This category of compressors is used in large-scale operations such as petrochemical refineries, power generation plants, and large-scale oil & gas extraction processes. Their ability to handle larger volumes of gas at high efficiencies makes them crucial in demanding industries where high-capacity compression is needed.

l **Over 12,000 m³/h**\
Compressors in this range are used in the most demanding industrial applications where massive volumes of gas need to be compressed efficiently. These include large-scale petrochemical operations, offshore oil rigs, and heavy-duty manufacturing processes, requiring continuous and high-efficiency performance.
