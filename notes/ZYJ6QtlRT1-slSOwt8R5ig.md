## HMW 幫助阿富汗? 

what they might need the most: spread the message and create political/social pressure in order for changes to happen

Whatever we do, seems unlikely that we're going to change anything.

Influencing corporations might be a way, they might have some local influence 透過商業可能會有些影響

outcome
1. taliban lift ban
2. some girls escape from taliban -> how can we help?
3. online learning

how can we leverage our connections in Taiwan media to bring more awareness?

What if we fundraise for them with crypto in order to create a narrative the media finds interesting to both increase awareness and bring in funds

what can we do with the funds?
use the funds to buy them education access online?

#### HMW provide alternative education to afkan women?

Here’s an example of afghan online school:
