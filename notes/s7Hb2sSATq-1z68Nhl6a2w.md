How to organize an editor’s meetup
====
## For Cofacts editor:
### 1. Connect the editors
* The goal: Build a strong editor team, reduce the numbers of unresolved hoax-bust requests.
* Find editors who are willing to attend our events regularly and use the **“Sell through the community”** strategy.
* Take Hideki Ojima’s [“How to Build YOUR community”](https://www.slideshare.net/hide69oz/20170318-community-leadersopen) speech as a reference, the foundation of building a strong community is to find core role-models and followers.
    * Editors’ Meetup
        * Organize a meetup once a month, create a poll to decide the date, time and location of the event in our Facebook group in the third week of the previous month.
        * Ask the editors to invite a friend who’s interested on their second attendance. (Refer to a possible editor applicant to increase the numbers of our editor recruits.)
        * Organize regular meetups for introducing one another, mingling and experience sharing.
          > If the community engagement is not active enough online, try organizing an offline event so the editors may know one another and mingle, resulting in a more active online community.
        * At our meetups, we interviewed the participants’ experience in each event and also discuss about the latest hoaxes.
          > Share a hoax as an example, you may also use live-streaming as a tool to promote.
    
    * Encourage online discussion.
        * Post about the recent hottest request with no response yet. Use hashtags like #frequentlyrequested or field of expertise (e.g. #agriculture) and explained shortly what the request is about.
        * If the request is responded, ask the editor who responded to help responding and answering the survey.
        * Only post about one single hoax request at a time, it’s way better than to write about multiple hoaxes at the same time.
        * Share related hoax-busting articles or links to attract attention.
    * Share our achievement with editors’ community monthly.

### 2. Cross-functional collaboration.
How To:

1. We list and give credits to all of our collaborative partners who help us with fact-checking on our website.

    >Collaborative partners:
    >* PanSci: food safety, health and wellbeing related. 
    >* MedPartner: aesthetic medicine and cosmetic/plastic surgery related.
    >* Taiwan Environmental Information Association: Environment protection. 


2.We provide our data for our collaborative partners to use.
* We organize and share regularly what our LINE bot has achieved through our services with our editor community.
* We share the number of the same request submitted, most frequently requested hoaxes and in what field of expertise they’re in.
* We also analyze data and sort them into monthly report to share with everyone.


## Community Meetup
We tend to schedule a meetup once per month. We’ll create a poll in our Facebook group for the date, time and location of the event. The poll will happen in the third week of the previous month. Ask the editors to invite a friend who’s interested on their second attendance. (Refer to a possible editor applicant to increase the numbers of our editor recruits.)

### 1. Basic Tutorial for Editor Beginners
* How to search for fact.
* How to write a proper response.
* How to use the system.
* Take “how Wikipedia does it” into account: provides editor beginners the ground rules of editing, verifying and referencing on a monthly basis.


### 2. Editor’s Meetup
#### The purpose of editor meetups is to organize and assign unresolved requests, share editing experiences and achieve team coherence.
#### * Off-line first, Output first, Context first
* Organize regular meetups for introducing one another, mingling and experience sharing.
* At our meetups, we interviewed the participants’ experience in each event and also discuss about the latest hoaxes.
