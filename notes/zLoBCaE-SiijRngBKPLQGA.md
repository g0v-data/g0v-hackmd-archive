“Most guys have something to offer, if they can get past the initial interview. ”

This is brilliantly lucid, and shirley true…so many quality guys get DQ’d on at the first step, and if they never figure out how to make that first step work they lose confidence in their own value. 

“It boggles my mind when a woman assumes my ability to restrain my sexual desires around her is a testament to how much I respect her. As though, my not wanting to sleep with her is because I think more highly of her than the other women who I do want to sleep with.”

Well damn… I don’t think I’ve met a man who didn’t want to sleep with me yet. But if I did, and he was not making passes at me, I would think something he respected to some degree where he was willing to wait…(Because I’m just that hot ;) lol Otherwise, I would think he was on the same team I’m on.
