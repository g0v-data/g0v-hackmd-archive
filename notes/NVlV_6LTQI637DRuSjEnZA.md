The layup process is preferred in sectors that require custom, complex shapes and high-quality finishes.

l **Filament Winding**\
Filament winding is primarily used in the manufacturing of pipes, tanks, and pressure vessels. This process involves winding resin-soaked fibers around a rotating mandrel to create strong, cylindrical structures. Filament winding offers excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, making it a preferred choice for infrastructure projects and industrial applications.

l **Injection Molding**\
Injection molding is an automated process that enables the mass production of composite parts with high precision. This technique is widely used in the automotive and electronics industries, where consistent quality and high production volumes are required. The growing demand for lightweight and fuel-efficient vehicles is driving the adoption of injection-molded composite components.

l **Pultrusion**\
Pultrusion is a continuous manufacturing process used to create long, uniform composite profiles, such as beams and rods. These profiles are widely used in the construction and electrical sectors for their strength, durability, and resistance to environmental factors. Pultrusion's efficiency and ability to produce complex shapes contribute to its growing use in various industries.

l **Compression Molding**\
Compression molding is used to produce high-strength, complex parts at lower costs. It is commonly used in the automotive and aerospace industries for large-scale production. This process offers a cost-effective solution for producing lightweight composite parts with excellent structural integrity.

l **Resin Transfer Molding (RTM)**\
RTM is an automated process that produces high-quality, complex composite parts with minimal material waste. This method is widely used in the aerospace, automotive, and wind energy sectors. The precision and efficiency of RTM make it ideal for producing components with intricate designs and high mechanical properties.

### **Segmentation by Application**
