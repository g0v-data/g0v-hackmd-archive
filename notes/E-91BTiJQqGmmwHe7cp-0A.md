## About g0v Summit

g0v Summit is a biennial gathering focuses on open government, open-source collaboration, and citizen participation. It is a high-profile event of the international open government movement. The past 3 summits have attracted speakers from 33 countries. 

Almost all of g0v Summit is organized by volunteers and community contributors, preparatory documents and discussions are made public as collaborative notes. The programming of g0v Summit adheres to an open and collaborative spirit. Participants are encouraged to share and cowork their notes during sessions. Simultaneous interpretation, sign language interpretation, and live-streaming are provided to create a easy, friendly, and inclusive environment for participation. In addition to the planned agenda, g0v Summit also has “unconference” of which the topic is determined by participants’ proposals. It creates new collaborative spaces in the form of speeches, discussions, and workshops. Finally, borrowing from a tradition of the open-source communities, participants can also sign up “lightning talks” to share their ideas to everyone at the conference. The spirit of openness and sharing runs throughout g0v Summit.
