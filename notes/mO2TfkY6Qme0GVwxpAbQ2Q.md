## About Me 

My name is Sam, I am a student at the Univeristy of Cambridge in the UK, studying Chinese Studies. I am currently living in Taipei, learning Mandarin here. 

I am in the process of writing a thesis about **misinformation in Taiwan**, specifically the **TAIWAN ELECTION 2024**. 

If it is possible, I would like to interview anyone who could talk to me about their experience encountering misinformation in Taiwan during this period. 

## Question 1

Did this organisation, or anyone here personally have any active role in combatting misinformation in this period?

## Question 2

Where do you believe this misinformation came from?

## Question 3

What changes were there between misinformation in previous elections (2016, 2020, etc.) and this election (2024)?

## Question 4

Do you have any other information that may be of interest to me?

# Thank you!
