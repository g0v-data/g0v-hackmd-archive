```

```

1. Change directory to "own"
```
cd own
```

2. Now in "own" directory, you first install React related files by the following command:
```
yarn
```

3. Test if client (React) is installed correctly by:
```
yarn start
```

You should see a guesing game window with a "start game" button

4. The server can be started by the command:
```
yarn server
```

However, since the server code is not yet finished, you won't be able to play the game.

5. Now you can start coding. All the TODOs are specified by the commented "TODO". You should be able to finish the project by implementing these TODOs.
