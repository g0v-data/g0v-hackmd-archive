# (Maybe) FtO / g0v-intl @ TICTeC 2020

## Idea 1 (not submitted)
- Perspective: FtO community as a whole
- What have we been doing for the past 2 years in the FtO community?
- An almost complete (?) timeline of civic hacking / civic tech communities in JP, KR, TW, HK

### Title

Our sea of communities: collaboration and its impact among civic hackers in East Asia

### Abstract (300 words max)

Civic hacking community participants from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong started discussing the possibility of cross-border collaboration in East Asia in late 2018. After times of conference calls, site visits and helps from each other, the first Facing the Ocean Meet and Hack (FtO) was held in Okinawa, Japan in June 2019. More than 40 civic hackers joined the event and more than 10 proposals were pitched and collaborated by attendees from different countries. The experience was so encouraging and the results so fruitful that the 2nd FtO was held 6 months later in Tainan, Taiwan in December 2019. In this session, the speakers from FtO are going to share how an open culture approach formed an trans-national network of communities, a timeline mapping out the development of civic hacking / civic tech communities in JP, KR, TW, and HK. As well as FtOâ€™s regional projects such as a multi-lingual website about the controversial Extradition Bill in Hong Kong, born the day before the 1.03 million people march on June 9th, and the unexpected development after that. 

## Idea 2 (submitted by pm5)
- Perspective: g0v-intl

### Title

Ongoing "meet and hack" as a change-maker to democratic society

### Abstract (300 words max)

Over 7 years, g0v (pronounced "gov-zero") Taiwan have been continuously having hackathons every two months.  Held by g0v jothon task force, and welcomes everyone who wants to contribute their skills, this becomes an occasion where technical or non-technical solutions to social problems are proposed, prototyped, tested, and often put to work.  A few of us wants to extend this way of connecting people together towards building international networks of civic hacking communities.  We founded g0v international task force (g0v-intl), and worked with communities in Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, to co-organise Facing the Ocean Meet and Hack (FtO) events.  In 2019, we have had two successful events, each has more than 40 civic hackers from four countries working together, and we are expecting a few more events this year.  From the perspective of g0v international task force, we believe the expression "meet and hack", coined by Japanese organisers, explains the two elements that should be at the center of civic hacking: people, and solutions.  The two are connected by agency, which is what we try to foster in our ongoing hackathon-like events.  With the threats to democracies becoming ever more imminent in East Asia, there are projects advocating basic human rights, fighting disinformation, or protesting controversial bills.  We want to share the collaborations we see happening in these FtOs, provide our understandings of why this is working, and explain with these experiences why we believe a strong democracy is one that roots in communities.
