# 開放建築設計平台系統 An Open Framework Architecture Design Platfrom for Designer. "Architecture without Architects"

**科技+建築，如何應用科技回應當代社會重要的環境與居住議題，也就是面對"70%人類居所"的營建議題？**

**Technology+Architecture for the 70% of the human habitat. How can we combine technology in respond to our built-in environment and habitation?

摘要 Abstract :
自1999年921地震後，謝英俊建築師就所發展出的新型建築構築系統，旨在秉持可持續性的理念、結合科學方法，將社會、文化經濟條件融入，以就地取材、適用技術、簡化工法、降低成本正技術門檻等原則，建立出開放式的構造體系平台，讓建築專業者、材料供應商、使用者等市場角色皆可一同參與。

Hsieh has devoted himself to post-disaster reconstruction for almost 20 years. His projects often originated from the need to provide a prompt response to unexpected environmental emergencies. Observers often connect Hsieh and his team with post-disaster reconstruction, or view them as ‘humanitarian’ architects. But it is more appropriate to say that their confidence lies in the faith of developing an open-framework housing industry and network for the people, by the people.

Following the massive earthquake in Taiwan on September 21, 1999, guided by the simple tools and environmental-friendly materials in the Thao aboriginal tribe, Hsieh and his collaborators were able to complete reconstruction within extremely tight economic parameters. In 2004, Hsieh traveled to rural areas of Hebei, Henan, and Anhui to promote cooperative, sustainable building in the countryside to demonstrate a novel and effective integration of rural social and economic conditions. In the wake of the devastating May 12, 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, Hsieh and members of his Rural Architecture Studio aided in reconstructing homes for disaster victims in isolated mountain areas, beginning with the erection of more than 500 model homes. When the August 2009 typhoon ravaged Taiwan’s mountainous and riparian areas inhabited by indigenous minorities. Hsieh was entrusted by a number of charitable organizations with the task of rebuilding longstanding tribal homes and to work toward permanent housing arrangements. Hsieh and his team rebuilt a total of 1000 homes for members of 13 different tribal groups.

Over 70% of the world’s populations make their own homes in the rural areas. However, most professional architects are out of their depth in this sphere. Hsieh Ying Chun and his team proclaim that modern architecture is not a narrow means of technology and industry. Through the use of local-sourced materials, low-cost building strategies, appropriate technologies, and an open-framework structural system, the team has considerably lowered costs and technological thresholds in many of extreme situations. As homeowners are able to participate in their own home-building projects that are sustainable and affordable, they are empowered with a resilient building technology not only acknowledges the ownership of homes but also their dignity and culture.

**關於提案人: 謝英俊建築師事務所**
**About US**
我們是謝英俊建築師事務所的員工，共有4位參與這次的大會，希望藉由此次大會認識不同工作領域及專業的人群，就我們20年來所發展的經驗下，可以有共同合作的機會。

團隊簡介：

常民建築由謝英俊建築師事務所、達文營造股份有限公司、成都常民世紀建築科技有限公司所聯合成立。

謝英俊建築團隊自1999 年開始致力於強化輕型鋼結構住宅系統(Reinforced Light Gauge Steel, R.L.G.S.)的研發和推廣，先後完成臺灣 921 地震災後原住民 部落 300 餘戶重建、四川 512 地震汶川、茂縣、青川等地 500 餘戶農房重建，臺灣 88 水災原住民部落 1000 餘戶重建，西藏牧民定居房，尼泊爾 425 地震重建等多項工作。2014 年起開始將業務推展至非州、南美、東南亞及俄羅斯。

經過多年探索和實踐，現已開發出足夠簡化和具有開放性的技術體系，可應社會需求，提供施工便捷、建造快速、成本低廉、環保節能、極具針對性和深具市場價值的強化輕鋼住宅系統。 我們相信，擁有安全堅固、經濟舒適的住宅是每一個人的權力; 我們也相信，建築終將回歸環境、生態、人文、永續。 長年致力於生態農房研發與建設工作，秉持「可持續」的理念， 結合科學方法，深刻地將「社會」、「文化」、「經濟」條件融 入，以就地取材、低成本、適用技術以及建立開放式構造體系的 作為，降低成本與技術門檻，讓農民也能參與符合綠色環保、節能減碳的現代化家屋興建。

我們目前是一組人數精簡、經驗背景多元、工作型態不斷在轉變成長的團隊。除了擁有謝英俊建築師事務所二十多年來在臺灣所累積的設計經驗基礎，更具備了無數強化輕鋼系統實際項目的具體操作及實踐的寶貴經歷。

Introduction:

We are a team currently made up of great independent core members, with a wide range of experience and background, working efficiently together and constantly in the process of transformation and growth.

Our principal architect, Hsieh Ying Chun, devotes himself to post-disaster reconstruction for almost 20 years. He considers architecture and town-planning a collective endeavour and participatory effort. His projects often originated from the need to provide a prompt response to sudden and unexpected environmental or climatic emergencies focus on principles such as biocompatibility, sustainability and self-sufficiency. 

Since 1999, Hsieh’s reinforced light-gauge steel framing system has been developed and practiced through actual projects including: 300 houses reconstruction after the 921 earthquake in Taiwan, 500 an more rural houses rebuilt after the devastating Sichuan Earth quake, a total of 1000 more homes for members of 13 different indigenous tribal groups after the typhoon Morako ravaged Taiwan’s mountainous areas. Other projects ranged from Tibetan permanent dwellings to post-earthquake self-sufficient reconstruction in Nepal and many other ongoing projects around the world. 

Through years of exploration and actual practice, we have developed a simple bur versatile construction system that can provide swift solutions and innovative approaches based on different social needs and environment. It is not only a building system that is fast and low-cost but also resilient and sustainable to the environment and communities. 

We believe that everyone has the right to build their own home. 
We aim at building low-cost, harmonious residential community for common people at any accessible places. 
We believe that people’s right to own a structurally safe and sturdy house should never be taken away from them by any other persons or institutions, regardless of being in rural or urban setting.
