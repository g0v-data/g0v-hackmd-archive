The search engine optimization (SEO) space is full of changes, and to be successful, it is important to keep abreast of the developments within Google’s ranking algorithm. In the present day, which is the year 2024, numerous modifications have been introduced by Google to how it ranks web content and presents it to the public; thus, businesses and content creators must make some changes. Among these changes are the increased shift towards artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence in search results, and more focused attention on mobile-first indexing, user intent, and experience. Placing importance on such changes and making smart modifications to the way one does SEO will, among other benefits, enhance the chances of a website being found, increase the volume of organic traffic, and help get the right content to the people it is meant for.

To enhance the rankings and sustain a vigorous online presence, we’ll discuss the measures you can undertake ie. These include improving Mobile Page Experience, improving E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness’), and adjusting to AI search optimization.

## Key Changes in Google’s 2024 Algorithm

When it comes to the changes introduced by Google in the year 2024, several crucial changes were made in the factors affecting the position of the websites and the presentation of search results. These changes are indicative of the fact that Google is trying to achieve something more than just delivering the search results users have expected. For instance, there have been changes in the search results emphasizing more on artificial intelligence, a more pronounced focus on E-E-A-T (experience, expertise, authority, and trustworthiness), focusing more on user intent rather than keywords, and the mobile-first indexing approach. Let’s break these down further and discuss what implications these changes have on your SEO strategy individually.

### Increased Focus on AI-Driven Search Results
Among the anticipated changes to occur in the year 2024 is the use of AI by Google in search engines, with special emphasis on generative AI to improve search engine results. With the help of generative AI, Google can give more elaborate and context-specific answers to a person’s search query. For example, if an individual type in the text “best coffee makers of 2024,” rather than providing only a list of URLs, Google’s AI will most likely offer an overview of the best coffee makers, their attributes, and reviews from various sites on the differences of the coffee makers. This development implies that the content on the sites has to be of high quality and rich in structure such that the AI systems can effortlessly understand the content and produce the responses.

Attuning user search behavior is not limited to the query entered by the user but extends to understanding the entered query. In previous times, it was solely a matter of inserting the required keywords. Now, Google AI is advanced to the extent that it knows the semantics of the keywords. For instance, in the past, one had to state, 'How to fix a broken faucet,'' and Google would only return lists of web pages with the words fix or faucet. Modern-day IR search, however, can also interpret the meaning of such a query, i.e., that the user is likely on the verge of looking for a very detailed story on how to go about fixing a broken tap and be able to provide solutions to that problem, as opposed to only submission of pages with that phrase. Consequently, with the emphasis that most SEO interventions address user problems, it is envisioned that content that will solve the challenge will be created naturally and comfortably, which will be AI’s ranking advantage for that content.
