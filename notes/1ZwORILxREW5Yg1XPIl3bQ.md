# Seamless Switchover: Blue-Green Front-End Deployment

A key idea in contemporary software development and deployment methods, especially in the context of the [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/#:~:) paradigm, is [blue-green deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html#:~:). The difficulties of introducing updates and new features to web-based apps without upsetting users or causing downtime are addressed by this deployment model. 

## Definition and Concept
Maintaining two distinct but similar environments—referred to as "blue" and "green"—is the task of blue-green deployment. These environments are functionally identical since their hardware, software, and configurations are mirror images of one another. The green environment is where updates and new features are staged, whereas the blue environment is the application as it is currently available for use.

## Purpose and Significance
Enabling the smooth and continuous distribution of updates, features, and bug fixes to online applications is the main goal of blue-green deployment. Blue-green deployment enables developers to push changes to the green environment without impacting the live production environment (blue), as it maintains two parallel environments. This guarantees that during the deployment process, users encounter little to no [downtime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtime).

### Advantages of Blue Green Deployment
The following are the advantages of blue-green deployment:

* Reduced Downtime: One of the key advantages of blue-green deployment is its ability to minimize downtime during updates. Since updates are first deployed to the green environment, any issues can be detected and resolved before switching traffic from blue to green. This ensures uninterrupted service for users.
  
* Rollback Capability: Blue-green deployment provides a built-in rollback mechanism. If an issue arises after deploying an update to the green environment, traffic can be quickly redirected back to the blue environment, restoring the previous stable version of the application.
  
* Risk Management: Having two identical environments allows for effective risk management. If unexpected issues occur in the green environment, the blue environment remains operational, serving as a backup. This ensures that the organization can continue providing services even in the event of failures.

* Seamless Updates: Blue-green deployment enables seamless updates by gradually routing traffic from the blue environment to the green environment. This gradual transition minimizes the impact on users and allows developers to monitor the deployment process in real-time.

## Testing in Production
Testing can be done in a green, production-like environment with blue-green deployment. This lessens the possibility that end users may be impacted by defects or performance problems by enabling developers to find and fix problems early in the deployment process.

### Advantages of Testing in Production with Blue-Green Deployment
The following are the advantages of testing in production with Blue-Green deployment:

* Real-World Conditions: Developers have a realistic environment to test their modifications and assess how well they operate in production. This enables them to evaluate the behavior of the application in real-world usage scenarios, encompassing different user traffic and data loads.

* Early Issue Detection: Developers are able to identify problems early in the deployment process by testing in a green environment. They are able to find defects, compatibility problems, or performance bottlenecks thanks to this proactive strategy, all before the updates are pushed out to the whole user base.

* Rapid Feedback Loop: Testing in production facilitates a rapid feedback loop, where developers can quickly iterate on their changes based on real-world observations. This agility allows for faster resolution of issues and more efficient development cycles.

* User-Centric Testing: With testing in a production-like environment, developers can focus on user-centric testing scenarios. They can simulate user interactions and workflows to ensure that the changes meet user expectations and provide a seamless experience.

* Continuous Improvement: Testing in production fosters a culture of continuous improvement. Developers can continuously monitor and analyze the performance of their changes in the green environment, leading to iterative enhancements and optimizations over time.

### Best Practices for Testing in Production with Blue-Green Deployment
There are recommended practices for blue-green deployment that should be adhered to to guarantee a smooth transition. Among these methods are:

* Isolated Testing: Ensure that testing in the green environment does not impact the live production environment (blue). Isolate the testing environment to prevent unintended disruptions to end-users.

* Gradual Rollout: Gradually introduce changes to the green environment and monitor their impact before scaling up. This approach allows for controlled testing and minimizes the risk of widespread issues.

* Monitoring and Observability: Implement robust monitoring and observability tools to track the performance and behavior of the application in the green environment. Real-time insights enable early detection of anomalies and facilitate timely interventions.

* Fallback Plan: Have a fallback plan in place in case issues arise during testing. Ensure that there is a seamless mechanism to revert changes and switch back to the stable production environment if needed.

* Automated Testing: Leverage automation tools to streamline the testing process. Automated tests can be executed quickly and consistently, ensuring thorough coverage of test scenarios and reducing manual effort.

Example Scenario:
Consider a social media platform introducing a new messaging feature. With blue-green deployment, the development team can test the new feature in the green environment, simulating real user interactions and message exchanges. They monitor the performance of the feature, including message delivery times, user interface responsiveness, and server resource utilization. If any issues are identified, they can quickly iterate on the changes and retest until the feature meets quality standards. Once validated, the feature is seamlessly rolled out to the live production environment, providing users with a smooth and reliable messaging experience.

## Use Cases

Blue-green deployment is commonly used in various scenarios, including:
  
* Web Applications: For rolling out updates, new features, or bug fixes to web-based applications without downtime. Examples of web applications that utilizes this deployment strategy includes [LinkedIn](https://ng.linkdin.com) and [Github](https://github.com).
  
* E-commerce Platforms: For ensuring continuous availability of online stores and minimizing disruptions during updates or maintenance. Examples of e-commerce platforms that utilizes this deployment strategy includes [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) and [Etsy](https://www.e).
  
* SaaS (Software as a Service) Platforms: For deploying updates to cloud-based applications while maintaining service availability for users. Platforms such as [SalesForce](https://www.salesforce.com) and [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) utilize this strategy. 

## How does Blue Green Deployment Work?
Blue-green deployment operates on the principle of maintaining two identical yet separate environments, allowing for seamless updates and minimal downtime during the deployment process. Below is a detailed explanation of how blue-green deployment works, along with examples where necessary:

### Working Principles
We'll use the image below to illustrate the working principles of blue-green deployment.

Source: aws.amazon.com

In the Blue-Green deployment model, two environments are utilized: Blue and Green. Let's illustrate this with an example. Assume that version 1 is the current version of the application, while version 1.1 represents the new update. Version 1 is designated as the blue environment, while version 1.1 is the green environment.

### The Process of Switching Traffic Between Environments
As seen in the above image, [load balancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)) and routers are used to move users from the Blue instance to the Green one. Load balancers provide instantaneous switching in contrast to [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) record changes, which may take some time to propagate. The load balancer directs fresh traffic to the Green environment by using the same DNS record, enabling smooth user control. In the event that there are problems with the green instance, this is essential for rapidly rolling users back to version 1 (the blue instance).

### Deployment and Parallel Running
The Green instance (version 1.1) runs concurrently with the older version in production after it is judged ready. Traffic is seamlessly diverted from the Blue instance to the Green instance via the load balancer. As they effortlessly access the updated version of the service or program, the majority of users won't even notice the move.

### Monitoring
Once traffic is routed to the Green instance, smoke tests are carried out by DevOps engineers to make sure the updated version is operating as intended. They can find any problems with the new version before they have a significant impact on a large number of users thanks to this crucial stage. It makes sure that everything is functioning as it should in the latest version.

## Deployment Process
In this section we'll dissect the various steps used in the deployment process. Blue-green deployment follows a series of steps to roll out updates and changes smoothly:

### Step 1: Duplicating Resources
The first step involves duplicating all resources used by the application in both the blue and green environments. This includes duplicating databases, server configurations, and any other components of the application infrastructure.
   
For example:  
The organization ensures that both the blue and green environments have identical copies of the database, ensuring that data consistency is maintained across both environments.

### Step 2: Updating the Server
Once the resources are duplicated, the next step is to update the green environment with the new features, updates, or bug fixes. This involves deploying the changes to the green environment and testing them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
   
For example:  
The development team deploys a new version of the website with updated features, such as a redesigned checkout process, to the green environment. They then conduct extensive testing to verify that the new features function correctly and do not introduce any issues.

### Step 3: Switching Traffic to the New Server
After the updates have been deployed and tested in the green environment, traffic is gradually switched from the blue environment to the green. This is typically done using a routing device, such as a load balancer, that redirects incoming traffic to the green environment.
   
For example: 
The organization configures the load balancer to start directing a small percentage of traffic to the green environment while monitoring performance. If everything goes smoothly, more traffic is gradually shifted to the green environment until all traffic is routed there.

### Step 4: Relegating the Old Platform
Once all traffic has been successfully redirected to the green environment, the blue environment becomes inactive and is relegated to a backup or standby role. It is kept in this state in case a rollback is needed or as a reference for future updates.
   
For example:  
With all users now accessing the green environment, the blue environment is no longer serving traffic. It is maintained as a backup, allowing the organization to quickly switch back to it if any issues arise with the green environment.

## Continuous Cycle
Blue-green deployment is a never-ending cycle that alternates between the two environments—blue and green—in active and dormant roles on a regular basis. This cycle makes sure that updating procedures are smooth and effective while causing the least amount of inconvenience to users. Here's the procedure for contineous cycle:

### Regular Updates 
Blue-green deployment encourages frequent updates to the application or service. This could include bug fixes, feature enhancements, security patches, or performance optimizations. The development team continuously works on improving the application, iterating on feedback, and implementing new features to meet evolving user needs.

### Alternating Environments
At any given time, one environment is active (serving production traffic) while the other is inactive (ready for updates or rollback). Initially, the blue environment is active, serving the current version of the application to users. Meanwhile, the green environment remains inactive, allowing for updates, testing, and preparation for the next release.

### Rolling Out Updates
When a new update is ready for deployment, it is implemented on the inactive green environment. The green environment undergoes thorough testing, including functional testing, integration testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the update meets quality standards. Once testing is successful and the green environment is verified as stable, traffic is gradually shifted from the blue to the green environment.

### Transitioning Traffic
Traffic redirection is typically managed through load balancers or routing rules. Initially, only a small portion of traffic is routed to the green environment to minimize risk and allow for monitoring of performance and user experience. As confidence in the new version grows, more traffic is directed to the green environment until it becomes the primary production environment.

### Active and Inactive Roles
After traffic is successfully transitioned to the green environment, it becomes the new active environment. Meanwhile, the blue environment, which previously served as the active environment, is now inactive. The inactive environment serves as a backup or rollback option in case issues arise with the new version. The roles of the environments are then swapped, with the inactive becoming active and vice versa, ready for the next update cycle.

### Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
Throughout the deployment cycle, continuous monitoring of both environments is essential to ensure performance, stability, and user experience.

Any issues or anomalies detected in either environment are addressed promptly to maintain service quality. Feedback from users and stakeholders is collected and used to inform future updates and improvements, thus perpetuating the cycle of continuous enhancement.

Overall, the continuous cycle of blue-green deployment enables organizations to achieve rapid, reliable, and efficient updates to their applications or services while ensuring minimal disruption to users. By maintaining two identical environments and alternating between them, blue-green deployment provides a robust framework for deploying updates safely and efficiently.

### Benefits of Continuous Cycle approach to organizations 
This approach allows organizations to:

* Minimize Downtime: By switching traffic gradually between environments, blue-green deployment ensures that users experience minimal or zero downtime during updates.
* Reduce Risk:The ability to quickly switch back to the previous version (blue environment) in case of issues with the new version (green environment) reduces the risk of service disruptions.
* Ensure quality: Thorough testing in the green environment before transitioning traffic ensures that updates meet quality standards and perform as expected.
* Achieve Continuity: The continuous cycle of updates ensures that the application remains up-to-date with evolving requirements and market trends.
* Improve resilience: Having an inactive environment ready to take over in case of failures enhances the resilience of the deployment process.
* Enable Rapid Iteration: With a streamlined deployment process, organizations can iterate on updates more rapidly, responding quickly to feedback and market demands.

For example:  
After the green environment becomes the new live version, the development team starts preparing the next update in the now-inactive blue environment. This cycle continues, with updates being deployed to the green environment, tested, and then switched over to become the new live version.

## Types of Deployment 

In software development and deployment, various strategies are used to manage updates, releases, and maintenance of applications. Each deployment strategy has its advantages and challenges. Let's explore the different types of deployment, including blue-green deployment, and provide examples where necessary:

### Blue-Green Deployment
  
Blue-green deployment involves maintaining two identical environments, with one serving as the active production environment (blue) and the other as the staging environment for updates (green). Updates are deployed to the green environment and then gradually switched over to become the new production environment.
  
For example:
Consider a large e-commerce platform that uses blue-green deployment. The blue environment hosts the current live version of the website, while the green environment is used for deploying updates. When the development team wants to roll out a new feature, they deploy it to the green environment, thoroughly test it, and then gradually switch traffic from blue to green. If any issues arise, traffic can be quickly redirected back to the blue environment.

### Canary Deployment
Canary deployment involves rolling out updates to a small subset of users before making them available to the entire user base. This allows for early feedback and detection of issues before widespread deployment.
  
For example:
A social media platform adopts canary deployment to test a new feature. Initially, the feature is made available to a small group of users, such as beta testers or internal employees. If the feature receives positive feedback and shows no issues, it is gradually rolled out to a larger audience. This approach helps mitigate risks by identifying and addressing issues early in the deployment process.

### Rolling Deployment
Rolling deployment involves gradually updating servers or components of an application, typically one at a time or in small batches. This allows for updates to be rolled out without disrupting the entire system at once.
  
For example:
A cloud-based email service implements rolling deployment to update its servers. Instead of updating all servers simultaneously, updates are rolled out to a few servers at a time. This ensures that users continue to have access to the service while updates are being applied. If any issues arise, only a subset of users are affected, minimizing the impact.

### Recreate Deployment or Basic Deployment
Recreate deployment, sometimes referred to as basic deployment, entails bringing the application back online after it has been updated and completely offline. When compared to alternative deployment tactics, this method is less flexible and may cause downtime.
  
For example: 
A small business website undergoes a recreate deployment to update its [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) (CMS). The website is taken offline, the CMS is updated, and then the website is brought back online. During this process, users are unable to access the website, resulting in downtime. While this approach may be suitable for smaller organizations with minimal traffic, it is not ideal for high-traffic or critical applications.

### Multi-Service Deployment
Updating various parts or services of an application concurrently but separately is known as multi-service deployment. This makes it possible to roll out upgrades without having an impact on the overall program.
  
For example:
An online banking application adopts multi-service deployment to update its various services, such as account management, payments, and transactions. Each service can be updated independently, allowing the application to remain operational while updates are applied. This approach helps minimize disruptions and ensures that users can continue to access the application without interruption.

## Benefits and Challenges of Blue Green Deployment
Blue-green deployment has a number of benefits but also presents some difficulties. It is imperative that enterprises contemplating the use of this deployment approach comprehend these facets. Let's examine the advantages and difficulties of blue-green deployment, providing examples where needed:

### Benefits of Blue Green Deployment
The following are the benefits of blue-green deployment:

* Maintain a Standby System: A fully functional system (blue) is always available to act as a backup thanks to blue-green deployment. In the event that the active system experiences unanticipated problems or malfunctions, this backup system offers a safety net (green).
   
For example:
A banking application employs blue-green deployment to ensure continuous availability of its services. The blue environment serves as the standby system, ready to take over if the green environment experiences any technical issues. This ensures that customers can access their accounts and conduct transactions without interruption.

* Return to Former Iterations Right away: If there are problems with the new deployment, a swift rollback to an earlier version is possible using blue-green deployment. This feature guarantees that problems may be resolved quickly, reducing the effect on users.
   
For example:
A video streaming platform rolls out a new feature using blue-green deployment. However, users encounter playback issues with the new feature. The development team quickly rolls back to the previous version (blue), restoring normal playback functionality for users.

* Enable Deployment Without Downtime: Blue-green deployment gradually transitions traffic from the old version to the new version, hence eliminating downtime during upgrades or deployments. This guarantees that users won't see any interruptions when using the application.
   
For example:
An e-commerce website updates its product catalog using blue-green deployment. Traffic is gradually redirected from the old catalog (blue) to the updated catalog (green) without any downtime. Customers can continue browsing and purchasing products seamlessly during the update process.

* Ensure Smooth and Autonomous Upgrades: Blue-green deployment transfers traffic from the old environment to the new environment gradually, enabling automated and seamless updates. This makes sure that during the deployment process, users are not too disturbed.
   
For example:
A software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform updates its user interface using blue-green deployment. The new interface is deployed to the green environment and gradually rolled out to users. Users seamlessly transition to the new interface without experiencing any downtime or disruptions.

* Test in Production: Blue-green deployment allows you to test updates or new features in a production-like setting (green) without affecting end users. By doing this, it is ensured that any problems are found and fixed before being deployed to the live environment.
   
For example:
A social media platform introduces a new messaging feature using blue-green deployment. The feature is tested in the green environment, allowing the development team to identify and fix any bugs or usability issues before making it available to all users.

### Challenges of Blue Green Deployment:
Let's take a look at the challenges of blue-green deployment

* Costs: It can be expensive to set up and maintain two similar environments in terms of resources, infrastructure, and overhead. This can be a major obstacle for businesses with tight expenditures.
   
For example:
A startup company may find it challenging to afford the infrastructure required for blue-green deployment. They may opt for simpler deployment strategies initially to minimize costs.

* Difficulty in Scaling: Maintaining two similar environments and guaranteeing scalability can become more difficult and resource-intensive as the program and user base expand.
   
For example:
A rapidly growing online marketplace struggles to scale its blue-green deployment infrastructure to handle the increasing number of users and transactions. They may need to invest in additional resources and technologies to support scalability.

* Difficulty in Database Management: Managing databases in a blue-green deployment configuration can be difficult and may call for careful planning and collaboration, particularly when upgrades entail schema modifications.
   
For example:
An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system updates its database structure using blue-green deployment. The development team must ensure that both environments remain synchronized and that data integrity is maintained during the update process.

* Distorted User Transactions: User transactions might be lost or halted during the switch from the old to the new environment, which could result in a bad user experience.
   
For example:
An online banking application switches from the old environment (blue) to the new environment (green) using blue-green deployment. Some users may experience transaction failures or delays during the transition, requiring them to retry transactions.

## Conclusion
Blue-green deployment is a useful method for handling upgrades and releases in today's hectic software development environment, all while preserving service availability and reducing interruptions. Organizations can create dependable, effective, and resilient software delivery processes by tactically applying deployment techniques and carefully assessing the advantages and disadvantages.
