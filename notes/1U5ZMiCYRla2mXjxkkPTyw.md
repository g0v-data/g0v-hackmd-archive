What an incredible machine a car is. Your movement from one place to another is facilitated by mechanical movements. It's truly amazing how the engine transfers power to the wheels.

But what happens if an engine's full power is not transferred to the wheels? 

There are some flaws that are noticeable. One of them is the misaligned wheels, which detract from the car's performance while also providing a less than desirable experience.

Most drivers know how much it is necessary to keep an eye on the tire pressure. And, most of us take timely action when it comes to tire pressure. But, do you know about wheel alignment and its benefits? How does it help us in terms of safety and financially?

There should be no ignorance regarding wheel alignment either if you follow your vehicle's maintenance schedules to keep it in top condition. To emphasize this type of maintenance more, you must first fully comprehend what wheel alignment is.

A wheel alignment, as the name suggests, is the configuration of wheels along the axle as well as the road. It means the wheels should have proper adjustment with each other at certain angles while properly attached to an axle.

The wheel adjustments often get disturbed over time due to uneven riding while crossing over the bumps and potholes. A tire alignment requires square adjustments of the wheels with each other so they can move in tandem.

It is accomplished by adjusting a few parts and configuring and positioning the suspension system correctly. 

The procedure entails configuring the steering wheel into the center precisely and adjusting all suspension angles that affect tire movement and positioning.

However, this requires a certain level of expertise to deal with the misalignment, and an expert at a reliable service center would be a good choice.

## What Are The Real Reasons Behind The Misalignment Of The Wheels?

A common cause of the misalignment is constant striking with something mounted, such as a sideways or a stone along the road. However, small bumps and potholes also contribute enough to disturb the wheel alignment with the axle. 

However, such issues are not visible unless they are not experienced sufficiently while driving the vehicle. But how do you actually find out about the wheel misalignment? 

One major sign of a car misalignment is that it starts to drag to either side of the road, where you have to handle the steering with more force to keep it straight.

Another sign of a wheel misalignment is the feeling of stubborn vibrations even if you are riding on a smooth surface. 

The third and most visible sign of a car's wheel misalignment is uneven tread wear and tear of the front tires. The wear and tear usually appear either inside or outside of the tires.

These are tell-tale signs of a vehicle's misalignment. However, they can hint at some other underlying issues. Therefore, it is always better to opt for the service of an expert at Service My Car.

A wheel misalignment has an adverse effect on the gas mileage. As misaligned tyres drag through the road instead of steering in a straight direction,it is evident that the engine has to bear more loads to push the vehicle. This reflects well in terms of high fuel efficiency. 
While a proper alignment allows your vehicle to be less cruel to you in terms of fuel economy.

## Increase a Tire's Life

Misalignment is the true enemy of tyres. If you drive your vehicle for an extended period while its wheels are misaligned, the tyres are the first to feel the impact as they start to wear down in many ways. The tyre's sides may receive the wear and tear, or it may be a flatten tread block.
Despite the point of wear and tear, you end up opting for a new set of tyres every time.

## Better Steering

As it is stated above, a misalignment always results in an uncomfortable experience in terms of steering. You may find yourself holding the steering a bit tight to drive the vehicle straight as compared to normal.

Under normal conditions, you do not need to put extra effort in terms of steering as all wheels tend to drive in a straight line.

## Stay Away From Additional Repairs
