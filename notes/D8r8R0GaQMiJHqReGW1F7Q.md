與會者(順時針)：Dora, MG, YuMin, Au,  潘國材, ?玲, ttcat, YuTin, pm5, afi, Aaron, Margot, Darodes,  Amel, Pierre?, O??,


### Darodes (男主管)

our three missions:
1) **France Tres Haut Debit** 2013-2022 plan to spread internet across France (now only 25% population is covered with internet connection).  This is an important program for us because we believe for economic reasons it is very important to have full coverage of broadband.

2)  **La French Tech** French Tech Initiative to promote the ecosystem of French startups and economy.

3) **Programme Societe Numerique**  Foster Digital Society: make sure everyone in the society could participate in "digital revolution".

We're young (this agency is only 1yr old). 45 people


### Amal:

- This agency ( digital consult ) is very different from traditional hierarchical gov institution. we're trying to do things in a different, decentralized way.
- 30 members (male 15 ; female 15), members from civil society. In the (某個政府機構),  年齡差 is 30 yrs, so we hold a diverse points of view and hope to use digital tools to bridge the gap and start conversations.
- We're working on how to reform the process of public policy
- We're also pushing the gov to be more ICT friendly.
- We also want to push our renowned universities to adopt new technologies

### Ttcat

what's the relationship btw digital agency and digital council

### Amal

90% of our job are focusing on our main missions.
day to day

### Darodes (男主管)

Our relationship with CNNum is only informal because digital agency is only a smart part inside the ministry of economy.
It's a good time to rethink our relationship and agency with the coming  national election next yr.

**Pierre**?,
Although we're a national institution, we have local partners.
The digital society program has four programs (照片後補):
1) Coordinating local strategies on digital uses and services
2) Promoting a digital skills voucher: .  If you are a french designer you have to learn your computer skill somewhere.  We can give you a voucher and you can learn it anywhere.
3) Supporting digital literacy stakeholders and national-wide programs.  What could be a stakeholder? it could be a public library, private companies with computer where everybody can come and use it.  Everyone that participates in digital agency is considered a stakeholder.  There are big differences in different regions for everybody to use the public services.  If there are good programs in for example in the libraries we can identify it and try to scale it up to other parts of the nation.
4) we just launched a laboratory to deepen our understanding of the digital transformation last week. We funded a nation-wide ??? the aim is to combine academic research and government data to find out how to use and how to use better digital tools.

### Amal

the lab has a mission of how data is collected and how to use it. and think how to use data more qualitatively.
Is there already any feedback from other ministries?

### Pierre

Yes, it is an open process and everyone is welcomed to submit a research.

### Darodes

How is things going in Taiwan?

### Audrey

- regarding infrastructure, we're pretty much done.
- we're also teaching our agencies with design thinking.
- we also work with local govs and help small cities to build their own infrastructure
- we know that digital participation needs civil society and we put civil society at the front

### 潘國材

how do you allocate your resource? how you make decision if the proposal made by civil society may not be the main mission of digital agency?

### Amal

- we're so diverse that we focus on different topics.
- our advantage is that we can view public policies from a different angle.
- We resonate btw gov and civil societies

**Pierre**?
- How a policy making process, which is not necessary about technologies, to include digital method? (not sure if I heard it rightly.)

### Audrey

- it's not that we buy a lot of equipments so to promote digital education, but to build and open windows for ppl to adopt digital way of solving problems.

### Amal

How do you ensure the equality of promoting digital usages among for example different schools?

### Audrey

for K12 students: we give incentive for standard schools to help them transfer to digital eduction.

### Amal

What we have achieved:
- The law of open data is adopted!
- open budget
- biz regulation and consumers can now access to such data.
- (something about digital right)
- privacy. individual can ask what data is held and .... ?

### Aaron

Can you tell more about what challenges you face as promoting digital equality?

### Pierre

the biggest challenge is MONEY. We're lucky that local communities are active.

### Aaron

Is there any problem finding the ppl to train others?

### O?

No, the real challenge is not about ppl.


### Pierre

how to link btw traditional civil groups and technical groups. how to incl. traditional NGOs into digital services.

### ttcat

318 線上線下讓技術人與不同公民團體互動
OCF 籌組 delegation 讓傳統NGO可以也能參與 open gov discussion

### Amal

自白: my experience is that classical NGO despises these new, young approaches while the new young thought the established ones are not challenging enough!

### PM5

The crisis we met in 2014 did help to foster the communication btw different generations. After that, we even notice that the older generations are also seeking new ways on their own to adjust to this new age.
