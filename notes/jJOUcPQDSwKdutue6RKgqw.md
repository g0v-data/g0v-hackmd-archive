PRESS REQUEST

Dear g0v members,

It's an honour to be here! I'm Anna, a Berlin-based journalist writing a feature for Strelka Mag (https://strelkamag.com/en/) on how you, g0v, are leveraging technology to strengthen democracy, civil society and trust between government and citizens in Taiwan. Huge respect for the work you're doing!

I'll be speaking with Lisa in a brief interview on Saturday about the work you're doing. Here are the questions I'd like to ask. Your insights would be much appreciated.

If there's any further information I can provide about the project, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thank you in advance!

Best,
Anna
