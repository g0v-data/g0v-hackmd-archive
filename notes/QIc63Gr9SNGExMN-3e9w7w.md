- Alex, Recursive Public
    
    - AI TOOLS <-> vTaiwan
        - How can democratic process feed in to AI, and vice versa?
        - Recursive Public: ongoing discussion 
    - [5 things to try to produce](https://g0v-tw.slack.com/files/U05CYCSKLA2/F05DBAVAETY/draft_recursive_public_slides.pdf)

- Flynn, 
    - Minimum vTaiwan team?
    - What if we could get enough vTaiwan community involved couldn't?

- Ronny
    - yes, commited to manage backend 

- Martin
    - How could AI be used to improve vTaiwan process? 
    - Developed a tool through ChatGPT and had a workshop with Policy Advisors 
    - How do you get 500 people to meaningfully understand the incredibly complicated ...
    - We are going to propose something more hands-on and experiemental 
    - Builing on the relationships we have had...
    - Map out different challenges 
- Flynn
    - Realisticly 500 is a prove of scalability - as a mean to rule out 
    - Perhaps 9 out of 10 of the proposal is going to use some kind of sampling
    - vTaiwan has a track record of historical participation
    - Once you get the grant, you do the best you can



    - There's also a language barrier. 



From Jitsi: 

Yeah as a note I haven't used 
pol.is
 loads 
Flynn Devine says:Could be include a questionnaire? Would have to be optional but... 
Flynn Devine says:They want us to measure representation so is sort of important - but again, we could shift the focus towards multiple contexts (as long as we can at least get country data) 
Flynn Devine says:Or even just 'can we get a result' as the measure? 
Flynn Devine says:Me too - If I can join then I'm game to put in work, I'm just no confident in my ability as haven't run one before

＠teemo community developer. My full-time job will use LLM fine-tuning and pre-training.
I am also one of the webmasters of PTT BBS.
We are one of the largest non-profit communities in Taiwan
Civic communities. Like Reddit.
We decide our own subcommunity rules.

Below are my thoughts.
Basic Principles when we need to adopt AI into civic participation

1. When interacting with real people, he must clearly know that the human-computer interaction interface he uses is communicating with non-human beings.
2. Emotional support can be provided when real people know that the HMI is playing a role.
3. Allow artificial intelligence assistants to provide services that reduce the lengthy and repetitive time spent by humans, or allow artificial intelligence assistants to provide parts that find human omissions.
4. When artificial intelligence can recognize that two people on Twitter are in a gay couple relationship and are in a relationship, this type of service causes high anxiety among minority groups.
5. Information about the current temperature (Temperature in NLP / LLMs) must be provided.
6. Moderation / Content Filter / Policy should be generated by the community using a democratization mechanism, and can be switched in each of our discussion areas.
