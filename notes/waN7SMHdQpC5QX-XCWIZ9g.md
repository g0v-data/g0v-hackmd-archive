Website was performing terribly and I couldn't figure out why. Analytics showed people visiting but bouncing within seconds. Finally got a UX audit done and wow, there were so many issues I never noticed. Navigation was confusing, pages loaded slow, and the mobile version was basically broken. The audit team also did [excellent motion graphics work](https://gapsystudio.com/services/ux-audit/) to show me exactly where users were getting stuck using recorded sessions. Seeing actual user behavior was eye-opening - people were clicking on things that weren't buttons and giving up when forms didn't work properly
