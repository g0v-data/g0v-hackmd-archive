Our small marketing agency struggled to keep track of project budgets and vendor quotes, leading to overspending and missed discounts. Each department used its own spreadsheet, and approval chains spanned multiple email threads. I searched for a way to centralize all purchase orders, enforce budget limits, and compare vendor pricing automatically. One late evening I read about a procurement platform built for teams like ours, which included customizable approval flows and real‑time reporting. I clicked through to explore it further on the [precoro site](https://precoro.com/) and was impressed by how it streamlined workflows. After implementation, team members submitted purchase orders via a unified portal, managers reviewed and approved in seconds, and finance monitored all requests in one dashboard. We cut approval times by over 70 percent, negotiated better vendor rates, and finally kept our project budgets under control.
