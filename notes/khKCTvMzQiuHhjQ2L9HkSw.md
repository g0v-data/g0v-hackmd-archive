Dear \[invitee name\],

We are pleased to invite you to be one of the keynote speakers for g0v Summit 2016, scheduled at May 14-15, 2016 in Taipei, Taiwan.  The other keynote speaker of the conference will be  [Felipe Heus](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/fheusser)[s](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/fheusser)[er](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/fheusser), co-founder and former Director of the Chile-based civic tech organization Ciudadano Inteligente.

[g0v](http://g0v.tw/en-US/about.html)is a civic tech community established in late 2012 with deep open-source roots. With 1,000+ contributors through 30+ hackathons, it  is [recognized](http://sbaack.com/2015/11/19/scraping-the-global-civic-tech-community-on-github-part-2.html) as one of the largest group in the global civic tech community.  The  results are many civic-made tools for better information disclosure, citizen engagement, and online democracy.  g0v community is one of the major driving forces for official adoption of better Open Data practices in Taiwan, whose achievement is recognized by OKFN in their [2015 survey](http://index.okfn.org/place/).

g0v Summit 2014 had 43 speakers from 9 countries with diverse backgrounds, including Open Data evangelists, public servants, NPO/NGO workers, scholars, and entrepreneurs.

As the global civic tech communities continue to do exciting things to accelerate political changes, we'd like to invite you to share your thoughts and vision of the future, and to celebrate some of the small successes and stories with the attendees.  We are expecting 750 participants in 2016.

Please let us know if this would be of interest to you.   Kindly reply to the conference Program Chief, Mr. Pomin Wu, at <pomin5@gmail.com>.

### 給沒來過的人


倒數第二段改成以下：

The last g0v Summit in 2014 had 43 speakers around the world.  The speakers' backgrounds are diverse, including Open Data evangelists, public servants, NPO/NGO workers, scholars, and entrepreneurs.  Together with approximately 800 participants we enjoyed a lively discussion on how to bring the society forward with transparency and collaboration.  We sincerely invite you to give a keynote speech for the event next year.  The speech will be given in the morning of May 14, 2016.
