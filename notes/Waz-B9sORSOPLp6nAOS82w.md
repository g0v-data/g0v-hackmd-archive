### What defines a hoax?
**Example**：“Homosexuality is a disease. If the same-sex marriage bill passes, AIDS will become a pandemic.”

**Example**：“It is persimmon season, so please forward this message to your loved ones! Do not eat persimmon with yogurt drink nor with bananas - they are poisonous when combined together and it’s all over the news. A child died on his way to the hospital. Please forward this to everyone in your other groups! Do not wait until it’s too late, your family and friends will thank you for it!”

**Example**："Forwarded from professor Wu-Shou Chang of National Yangming University, Institute of Public Health: 7-Eleven, President Chain Store Corporation has announced major food safety issues. All of its subsidiary beverage brands’ products are made from tea leaves from Vietnam, which contains extremely toxic material – dioxins.
Prosecutors have taken swift action to seize nearly ten thousand tons of toxic Vietnam tea leaves at their tea factory in Longtan District, Taoyuan, which belonged to its subsidiary beverage brand Chai Li Won.
Uni-President Enterprises Corporation will announce shortly to initiate the recall to take all products of Chai Li Won off the market. Chai Li Won calls not to drink any of its tea products. Definitely pass this on to your loved ones and friends.”



### Cofacts LINE Bot is not a database for news.
1. If the message is not a possible hoax or scam, please do not forward it to the Cofacts LINE Bot. 
2. It will only respond when forwarded a controversial or suspcious message.
3. We will not investigate celebrity gossip.
4. We do not respond to messages regarding live weather forecasts or media interviews.

### We do not recommend that users use the Cofacts LINE Bot as a standard chatbot for testing random messages.
1. Cofacts LINE Bot does not have the functionality for chit-chat. It will only respond to possible hoax requests.
2. The messages forwarded to the database will sent directly to the public sphere, where it will be accessible to our volunteer editors.
3. Please note that if you choose to send a request to the database, you will not receive a response but you will create a record of a pending request. 
4. Please note that if the bot detects a hostile attack from an unwanted, aggressive, or abusive message, it will block the user for good.
