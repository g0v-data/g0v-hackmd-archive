## Updates since last meeting
* Date: June 7th(check-in; networking), 8th(event), 9th(check-out)
    * organizers from the 6th
    * I think many people need to leave earlry evening on 9th. Last flight from Naha, Okinawa to Osaka is 8pm. 
* Since Parti is busy with our own projects in Korea, not sure whether members can attend.   
    * Asking money from Seoul government won't be proceeded, (since we will talk about SGP.. and more freedom.) 
    * GJ will promote this event to KR DSI network.
* Code for Japan probably cannot help the travel fee for atendees. (Let me confirm w/ Hal) but many individuals are interested in joining the event. Nao is more than happy to help promotion through CfJ network. 


## Agenda
* Budget 
  - 20,000 USD: Not solely for international hackathon?  We will need to decide how much are we going to spend.
  - ref. 1,000 usd(bi-hackthon in tw; only on food, venue was free.) 
  - equipment
  - food 
  - Also a +20 ppl guesthouse for 2 nights on Airbnb usually needs 1,200 USD in average (like [this one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/26266250?adults=16&guests=1&toddlers=0&check_in=2019-06-08&check_out=2019-06-09&s=kHPxRX7f))
      - need to use the venue from the 7th
      - In Okinawa, rental cars will be needed as a  transpotation. 
  - Roughly speaking ~5,000 USD = accommodation + food + venue + local transportation

* How to register?
  - Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong(?), Macau(?)
      - Can we bring a frind from other countries?
  - Should we just open a web form (Google form or KKTIX or else) and expect people from all countries to register for themselves, or should we have some number of reserved tickets for each of the communities?
      - maybe using KKTIX
      - how many tickets to each community. 
  - Registration only means we will provide a place to live over the two day event.  The event is free.  If you have somewhere else to live and just want to attend the event, feel free to do so.
