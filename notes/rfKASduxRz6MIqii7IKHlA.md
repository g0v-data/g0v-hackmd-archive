謝謝大家
能來到這邊是我的榮幸
讓我先從一些歷史講起
我想這可以作為一種定調
為我現在要談的變化來定調
在90年代初期 ... 抱歉是90年代晚期
有個人叫 Larry Sanger
他在「知識學」領域
專門研究人類如何實證「信念」
很幸運地
他爭取到了一個身為「知識學家」為數不多的職缺
工作是協助開發一個全新百科全書
叫做「Nupedia」
當時類似的東西已經有一大堆
已經有其他百科全書專案正在進行
像是「Everything2」和「h2g2」
「Nupedia」將會是另一個線上百科全書
而「Nupedia」的特點是
他們將聘請專家寫文章
他們構築嚴謹的流程
在發布之前開發、認證、確認、實證文章
所以他們設計出一套流程
聘請這些專家
然後就這樣開始了
但他們卻沒有進行得很順利
在投入「Nupedia」約九個月的時間後
他們大概只發布了一打的文章
所以這個步調是不怎麼快
而他們就像新創公司一樣
他們沒有大量的資金
Sanger 也知道大難臨頭了
所以找上聘請他們的人
Jimmy Wales
他說：「這個『Nupedia』看來行不通」
「我們得試試別的」
Ward Cunningham 把這個東西稱作「wiki」
可以說是一種共同協作編輯的站台
那為什麼我們不試試「wiki」
作為一個只是為了撐下去的方法
來接電發動這台沒電的「創造列車」
既然看起來似乎也別無選擇
他們就這樣推出了「wiki」
Sanger 開始找人寫一些零碎的文章
這就是「Wikipedia」出生的過程
剩下的故事都是大家耳熟能詳的歷史
短短幾個月之間
「Wikipedia」已經產出遠遠多於
「Nupedia」整個高度計畫性的一生的文章量
就發生在該年的年底
「Nupedia」關閉，而「Wikipedia」則是蓄勢待發
所以先記著這件事
今年 (2013) 八月
在我住的地方─紐約
有個叫 Patrick McConlogue 的人
23歲
在一家名為「打倒資本家」的紐約公司工作
他像大家一樣在上下班的路上奔波
他像大家一樣看見很多無家可歸的人
但這次有一個傢伙對著他站起來
他說那傢伙看起來並不是極度苦惱
那傢伙看起來並不是十惡不赦
接著 McConlogue 發了一篇文章
關於這次的觀察、關於這個流浪漢
文章的標題是
_《找到那些不該無家可歸的人，並且教他們寫程式_》
McConlogue 的策略是
去跟這個傢伙說
「我明天會再來」
「你要我給你一百美元」
「還是你要三本 JavaScript 程式的書和一台筆電？」
這篇文幾乎是一發表就招來許多訕笑
它所隱含的卻被完全忽略
這一切的開端
是因為有一種人是「不該無家可歸的人」
而且你能從流浪漢之中分辨出這些人
他就去見了這個他一無所知的傢伙
甚至不想費心知道這傢伙的名字
在第一篇文章中他稱這傢伙為「駭客學徒」
而網路一如往常地
為之轟動
批評同時像雪片般飛來
細節被越挖越多
McConlogue 的 CrunchBase 資料被挖了出來
是的，他確實有 CrunchBase
其中大頭貼是 McConlogue 站在一艘船上
就在船舵的後方
手裡拿著一罐大瓶啤酒
我有提過 McConlogue 長怎樣嗎
你現在大概已經可以想像的到了
Leo，那個無家可歸的傢伙
是個黑人，你大概也已經猜到
就只是這樣繼續下去
我對這件事很有興趣
就開始讀那些批評
那些批評超多，而且超精彩
我偶然看到了 Noreen Malone 的文章
發表在 New Republic 的文章
Malone 說
「不要拿這種不實際的白日夢來煩我」
「這拿來創業可能有用」
「但不適用於思考社會問題」
這個說法讓我愣了一下
因為
這聽起來不太對勁，不是嗎？
不能因為你正在考慮的是社會問題
你就必須接受
所有現有的限制都是無可奈何的
這聽起來甚至不像在解決問題
而像是直接投降
所以後來我又繼續回去讀批評
但這次帶著全新的眼光
看看大家覺得
這個問題是否真的是無可奈何
我也開始讀文章下方的回應
又一次，回應也同樣離題
回應裡有些人說
「嘿！這人試著做點事情」
「雖然有點笨拙甚至滑稽」
「但至少他在做點什麼，別這麼嚴苛」
但還有另一種回應
令人難以置信地苛刻
但他們的苛刻不是針對 McConlogue
他們是針對 Leo
這些苛刻的評論者
他們一輩子沒有為這個人留神過
卻很「樂意」說出
「他明顯是個酒鬼」
「他一定沉迷於毒品」
「他可能是個小偷」
那些對眾人熱議的流浪漢最苛刻的人們
和那些認為 McConlogue 會失敗的人們
越來越不掩飾他們希望 McConlogue 會失敗
無論 McConlogue 再怎麼做
他都更加深他們的理念
認為流浪漢是個無法控制的問題
我這才意識到我一直在用錯的方式在讀批評
我以前都一邊看批評一邊說
「我同意這個、我不同意那個」
「這看起來是對的、那看起來是錯的」
但這不是批評的重要之處
批評的重要之處是在於
它到底有沒有幫助
Matt Yglesias
寫了一篇值得深思的文章批評 McConlogue
以教導 JavaScript 程式這種方式來拯救流浪漢
他說：「嘿！我們都知道流浪漢的問題」
「我們都知道無家可歸是起因於他們沒有家」
「解決問題的第一步是給他一個住處」
「如果不這樣做，你沒有解決任何問題」
對於這種評論你可以有很多反應
你可以說
「這很有趣，我們沒有注意到這點」
「我會改變我的作法」
你可以說：「我認為在紐約市是不同的」
「我認為對於某些類流浪漢」
「或是某些情況下，它是不同的」
但幾乎任何你能對 Yglesias 這篇文所做出的反應
都會讓你更聰明
這就是有幫助性的批評
幫助性批評會說
「我看見了你在那邊正在嘗試做的」
「我不認為那會可行」
「但來我這個角度」
「讓我展示從我的觀點看到的世界是什麼樣子」
然而還有另一種批評
跟 Yglesias 一樣苛刻
跟 Yglesias 一樣懷疑
但用完全不同的方式
這種批評充滿腐蝕性
他不是給出他的觀點
而是直接要你停止
就只要你停止你正在做的事
他不是要你用別的方法解決這個問題
而是直接要你「走開」
腐蝕性的批評
是針對解決問題的人
而不是問題本身
如果你聽聽那些幫助性的批評
也不是都歡樂又光明
很多幫助性的批評非常地苛刻
而且帶來傷害
但真正的問題是：他有沒有讓你更聰明
腐蝕性的批評則相反
腐蝕性的批評幾乎就定義是
不讓你更聰明地面對問題
而看著這些
看著這兩種對 McConlogue 批評之間的角力
我想沒有一個簡單的方法
來突顯 McConlogue 試圖做到的
同 Leo、對 Leo、為 Leo 這個流浪漢所做的
部份是好的，部份是壞的
沒有簡單的解答
沒有一個觀點可以闡明一切
接著我體認到該好好地探究一番
我還有為了探究其他兩件事而活
其中之一是網路的通用性
另一個就是社群媒體可行、吃重和擴展的可能性
大致上可以這麼說：一些新的工具冒出頭
人們看著它想「我可以用他做新的事」
任何新的科技使新事物成為可能
這就是它的功用
如果有一樣東西它不能創造新的可能
那要嘛它不是新的，要嘛它就不是科技
當你得到一項新的科技，你不知道該如何使用它
所以你四處走走，尋找它可能適合的地方
這就會經常遭受批評說
「這是在為工具找問題」
但這當然是這樣
當我們在九十年代初有了網路的時候
世界沒有一樣東西像網路
所以我們東試試、西試試
賣飛機票的方式不像網路、賣書的方式不像網路
搜索引擎，甚至連個影子都沒有
所以一開始的反應都是「喔，這不可行」
接著它就開始可行了
再來的反應就是：「喔，這不長久」
然後它就開始長久了
接續的反應是：「喔，這沒辦法擴展」
接著它就開始擴展了
然後你才意識到要來深究它
你才跟大家一樣了解到
這個東西與生俱來就為世界帶來了可能性
當初網路發生過一次
社群媒體發生過一次
看著 McConlogue 和 Leo 這次事件
我認為現在又正在發生
這個叫做「公民媒體」的概念
我們不再是用簡單想法和解答在辯論
不再只是拿來找路坑
不再只是用來認養消防栓
我們把它延伸到系統的各部份
我們實際上就是在找它合適之處和理由
所以這就是為什麼
分辨出幫助性批評和腐蝕性批評會如此重要
你必須要聽幫助性的批評
即使他們尖酸、即使他們苛刻、即使他們氣憤
因為應對它們會讓你更聰明
你無須理會腐蝕性批評
不是因為他們是錯的，他們幾乎總是對的
如果你想要感受一下當天才的感覺
那就去找個有人在嘗試新事物的地方
並告訴他們，他們會失敗
你10次會有9次是對的，20次會有19次是對的
你甚至不必了解他們正在解決的問題
演算法簡單如下
無窮迴圈：預測失敗
你幾乎每試必中，輕鬆寫意
但腐蝕性批評要你相信的東西
就是這句話
「幾乎怎麼做都沒有用」
顯然是個正確的句子
跟「怎麼做都沒有用」是一樣的
但這句完全錯誤
在人類歷史上的每個成功
都穿過了這個針眼般的縫隙
在人類歷史上的每個成功
都像線一樣通過了
「幾乎怎麼做都沒有用」
所以要了解
你是在什麼情況下去解決你的問題
你必須弄清楚
你把自己交付到的是什麼環境
你要用什麼資源，以及適合用在哪裡
你要怎麼對付這個問題
以及怎麼定義這個問題
最容易對付的問題、最完美的問題
就是「科技問題」
問題只在於你少了所需的資訊
如果你懂了
如果你要解決的問題，只是需要更多的資訊
而你使用數位工具，那根本是天堂
過去十年，這類工具能解決的問題不是碰巧
像是路坑報修
或許因為沒有路坑議員需要你去對付
或許市長的小舅子有個柏油廠
還用比你想像中貴的價錢去修路坑
但說真的，問題只在資訊
如果我能找出路坑
我就可以作的更好
這超讚的
路坑是一個問題，問題有了解法
這是再好不過了
如果你是在處理一個科技問題
你可以迅速進展，而不會有太多政治麻煩
除了科技問題之外，再上去還有「管理問題」
管理問題就會有一股緊張之弦
在「政府和政府試圖要做的」
與「公民和公民試圖要做的」之間拉扯
幾乎很多時候
必須要用更複雜的方式來溝通協調
當紐約市推出公用自行車計劃
他放上了一個地圖，然後基本上是說
「你想要租車站在哪裡，哪裡就會有一個」
當然大家會說
「我點，我要一個就在我家旁邊」
「我點，我要一個就在我公司旁邊」
現在這看起來像是路坑問題
在幫助我們找到可行的街角來放租車站
這是檯面上的理由
我們在把租車站的建置位置「群眾外包」
而檯面下的理由
則是要讓人們登錄進這個地圖，然後說
「我的天！好多人對公用自行車計劃都很興奮」
這個地圖不只是揭露資訊
它打從一開始就助長創造「計畫支持者」
管理問題比科技問題複雜得多
因為它不只需要資訊，還需要政治意願
需要跟公民溝通
而且要比只傳張附文字路坑圖片還更強烈
管理問題再上去就是「政治問題」
政治問題是最艱難的
政治問題即便在政府內部都會有歧見
當還只是在建構可能辦法的時候就會
你可以想像得到一個沒有建築物的城市
但是很難會有一個沒有妓女的城市
「妓女問題」沒有辦法完全解決
因為人們甚至對解決的目標都沒有共識
我不只是指美國政治常見的左右派之分
即便是同一陣營
即便都是極左派
都是有部份人想要消滅性工作
而有部份人想要讓性工作成為一個更好的工作
而這個問題永遠沒有一個解答
因為這個問題在簡單的定義上就有衝突
一旦上到了政治層級
你不再是在處理問題，你是在處理兩難
而你不會有一個解答，你只能權衡
所以你必須了解
你能權衡的是什麼
因此，如果人們想讓你錯亂
每當有人嘗試新東西，就會有人出來搗亂
最容易的干擾方式
就是暗示說你正在處理的問題不是真正的問題
如果你在處理一個科技問題
如果你說我只是需要更多的資訊來解決問題
我可以跳進來說
「沒錯，你在解決路坑問題」
「但真正需要解決的是全市的交通」
「你的小玩意不夠好」
如果你在處理一個巨大的政治問題
像是增加全市交通流量
我可以跳進來說
「這完全不切實際，你應該從路坑開始」
我永遠可以讓你錯亂
只要暗示你處理的層級是一個錯誤的層級
你必須了解你正在做什麼的原因之一
就是要避免被干擾
避免被無論是規模較大或較小的問題干擾
你還必須搞清楚什麼適合你
你是不是只是要想收集更多資訊
你是不是試圖在公民和政府之間搭起橋樑
還是你實際上是想要解決政府內部的爭論
而還是民生問題這類最艱難的政治問題
舉個例子
「Porto Alegre」式的公民參與預算
已經就在我們身邊，具體成文
而且是可行又有效的
雖然推行的速度非常非常慢
因為任何碰觸到一點政治流程的東西
真的都很難改變
那為什麼這些很重要
要能分辨出幫助性和腐蝕性批評
要知道你解決的問題是哪個層級
因為你所擁有最重要的資源
不是你的策略、你的計畫、你的戰略
也不是你的工具、你的技術、還是專案管理
你所擁有最重要的資源
是你改變自己的能力
從長遠來看，這才是重要的
在我昨天飛來這的途中
我看到了一則有趣的新聞
Leo
那個帶著筆電和 JS 書的流浪漢
昨天上午被捕
紐約警察把他從板凳上帶去市區
以睡在公園裡為由逮捕
因為他沒有任何家可以回
McConlogue 一如往常到了他們見面的地方
發現 Leo 不見了，發現咖啡杯散落一地
意識到事情大條了
找了個交通警察問說
「那個板凳上的人，你看見他到哪去了嗎？」
交通警察說「有，他被捕了」
接著 McConlogue 就去了市區
試圖保釋 Leo 出獄
並且爭取那台被沒收的筆電
現在仍在進行中，事情尚未明朗
Leo 仍然被關押
他的筆電仍然在警察身上
而 McConlogue 還在努力中
這或許會成功
McConlogue 這方有大量的資源
現在他們得到了多家媒體的關注
起因是 McConlogue 幾個月前展開的行動
雖然 Leo 的情況好轉了
但並不是因為找到了流浪漢問題的通解
這基本上是個童話般的教父故事
Tim O’Reilly 指出童話故事無法擴展其應用
但我不覺得這是這個故事它重要的部份
重要的部份是
McConlogue 從一個
隨意把流浪漢分為「應該」和「不該」的人
一個自在地談論流浪漢
卻未曾費心了解他目標對象名字的人
他從這樣子一個人
變成了一個願意犧牲自己的工作天試圖保出朋友的人
我告訴你，作為一個紐約人
沒有人會自願和紐約警察有任何瓜葛
那是個很大的轉變
長期來看這可能不重要
可能只是一個 McConlogue 下次在船上跟朋友分享的故事
關於他在此時此刻做的這件事
這是很可能會發生的
但很清楚的是 McConlogue 不會學到他現在所學到的
不會了解流浪漢問題
不會了解那些流浪漢所要面對的困難
如果他不是從一個錯誤的想法開始
而且願意實地去嘗試點什麼
什麼都不做的人
是不會學到新東西的
這種可能性
這種邊做邊學的可能性
就是在這邊最重要的資源
政府老是搞不懂這一點
政府幾乎是被設計來搞錯這件事的
政府說：「有啊，我們有一個大專案」
「我們做了所有的規劃，但進行得不順利」
「我知道，下次我們只會更用力地去計劃」
你不能期待只是更加用力地去計劃，就可以得到你要的
你不能期待只是方向瞄地更準，就可以把火箭送上月球
必須開始做並一邊修正
另一種極端情況也不管用
有一種人說：「我知道了，我們舉辦駭客松」
「在比賽期間，我們會想出一個解決方法」
這樣也不管用
駭客松不會讓你有解答
駭客松會讓你在一天半內做出一個引人注目的混搭品
駭客松的作用不是得到一個解答
駭客松的作用是對問題更透徹地理解
駭客松的產物不是能動的程式
而是在參與者間所建立的社會資本
所以我們都學了一課
我們都從「Nupedia」的故事裡學了一課
大家都知道「Nupedia」的失敗，是因為過多的流程
經歷過官僚的人都知道
當你開發新東西是像「Nupedia」一樣有七步的流程
代表著你有七個不同的地方可能使你完全停滯
這是我們從故事中學到的
但還有更深層的故事在裡頭
就在於讓「Nupedia」失敗的人
與讓「Wikipedia」成功的人身上
當 Sanger 需要人來嘗試「wiki」
他並沒有到網路上然後公開說
「來個人吧，我們試試這個」
而是找上共事九個月的同事
一起試著換個方式打造百科全書
他們建立了足夠的信任
對於目標有足夠的掌握度
而且願意嘗試新的東西
他也沒有要他們給出承諾
沒有要他們保證「wiki」一定會大成功
他很苦惱地去找他們
他很謙虛地去找他們
他說：「聽著，這可能行不通」
「但也敷衍我一下，花個五分鐘嘗試看看」
「Nupedia」的成果
不是一個失敗的百科全書和死掉的網址
「Nupedia」的成果
是人們願意嘗試新東西
「Wikipedia」這個世界史上最被廣泛使用的百科全書
只是個 B 計劃
這種能力
這種能把眾人集結起來的能力
因為信任和專注使他們能夠嘗試新的東西
幾乎是這裡最關鍵的一點
剛剛說的可能不是你的經歷
當你在設計專案
你的計劃 A 可能執行得很好
它有時會發生
但並不是常有的事
當你在設定什麼是你想做的事
或是對那些經歷過這種過程的人來說
最重要的是去體悟
你正在建立，你自己理解問題的能力
無論你開始著手處理之後遇到了什麼
那都是最寶貴的資源
我所見過的最好的硬體原型之一
Bernadette 帶到我其中一堂課上，她說
「我曾經以為我會建立第一個原型」
「以之向客戶展示他們問題的解決方案」
「但我卻體認到」
「你建立的第一個原型是為了向客戶表明」
「客戶根本還不了解他們的問題」
很多時候你很難了解人們
甚至他們直接告訴你他們要什麼
直到你可以展示一些完全錯誤的東西
另外一種能力
這種說「我們盡可能規劃」的能力
「我們盡可能了解問題」的能力
「我們朝著這個方向」的能力
是有用的，你必須這麼做
但你也不得不說
我們也必須知道
「我們自己才是最重要的資源」
努力解決問題的人們，從過程中學習的能力
由此而改變我們的想法
這才是從長遠來看成敗的起因
因為歷史中那些成功的大專案
幾乎沒有一個最終是當初開始的樣子
當你看著那些最後行得通的方法
你將會發現
一開始怎麼做並不重要
重要的是，接下來怎麼做
謝謝大家，祝你好運

Thank you all. It is a pleasure to be here.
Let me start with a little bit of history that I think would set some of the tone for the changes I'm seeing now.

So ~in the early nineteen......~ in the late 1990s rather, a guy named Larry Sanger who was an epistemologist, somebody who specialized in the study of how we justify belief, _lucked out_ he got one of the few open
positions available for a epistemologist. He was hired to help develop a new
encyclopedia was called NUPEDIA, "NU."

And there was a lot of this in the air at that time. There were other encyclopedia projects going on with
names like Everything2 and H2G2. And NUPEDIA was going to be another of these online encyclopedia projects. And the thing that characterize NUPEDIA was they were going to recruit experts to write the articles, they were gonna build _a rigorous_ process for developing and certifying and vetting
in fact-checking the articles before they got published.

So they design this process, they recruit this expert, they get going, but they don't get going very far.
About nine months into NUPEDIA they have created something like a dozen articles. So the pace of this, not fast. And they founded like a startup, so they don't have a huge amount of money. And Sanger can see the writing on the wall. So he goes to the guy that hired him, Jimmy Wales, and he says, "the  NUPEDIA thing isn't
working, we've gotta try something else. Ward Cunningham has this thing called wiki is kind of a collaborative editing site, why don't we try wiki as a way of just-getting-this-going will jump-start the creation **_Mart_**

So seeing no other alternative they put up a wiki, Sanger recruit some people to write some
stub articles and that of course is Wikipedia born in the rest history. Within months Wikipedia had generated far more articles than NUPEDIA had in its entire highly-planned life. And by the end of that year, NUPEDIA shut down with Wikipedia was off to the races.

So hold that thought.

In August this year in New York where I live, a guy Patrick McConnell lock

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,930
who was a 23-year-old who works at a

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,170
company called kick-ass capital in New
York walking

40
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,589
back and forth between home and work as
one does he saw a lot of homes people

41
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,950
as one does but there was one guy that
stood out to him he said with that guy

42
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:40,649
he doesn't seem completely distracted he
doesn't seem

43
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,310
completely decimated by situation and
cola put up

44
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,990
a post about this observation is about
this home and the title of the post was

45
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,900
finding the unjustly homeless and
teaching them to code

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,180
and a common strategy was to go to this
guy and say oh either come back come

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,150
back tomorrow either give you 100 bucks

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,099
I'm going to bring three books about
JavaScript and a laptop

49
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:13,620
you can the Laughing began almost
immediately when this post went up in a

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,319
wimp

51
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,000
one in that vein right for them all the
information that there was such a thing

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,580
as the unjustly homers

53
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,940
and you could sort those people out from
the justly homeless I

54
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,870
he went on to meet a whole plan for the
skies like without bothering to learn

55
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,780
his name in the first post he called him
the journeyman hacker

56
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,318
right and the Internet as it does

57
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,939
exploded right the criticism was
widespread an instantaneous

58
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:42,349
and the details just kept adding

59
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,709
up macaan logs CrunchBase profile first
ball he has a CrunchBase profile

60
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,840
work on much CrunchBase profile his him
standing

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
on a boat behind the captain's wheel

62
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,959
holding a Paul Boyd by got done I
mention the Macondo with what you

63
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,539
probably could figure that out by now
and that Leo

64
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:05,250
turned out to be the homeless guy's name
leah was black you could probably have

65
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,318
guessed it actually

66
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,539
just goes on and on to get interested in
this and I started reading the criticism

67
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:16,259
and it was widespread it was the
luminous

68
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,489
and I came across a piece by marine
Malone in

69
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,549
I in the new republic

70
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,100
and Malone said that don't bother me
with the factual limitations styled

71
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,480
dreaming

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,790
can be useful for startups was not so
useful for thinking about social

73
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,870
problems

74
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,600
another friend brought me up short
because that didn't sound right

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,070
is it right it can't be the case that if
you're thinking about social problems

76
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:45,719
you have to accept

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,220
that all existing constraints are
removable

78
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,780
that doesn't sound like problem solving
that sounds like capitulation

79
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:58,500
so then I went back and I started
reading the criticism again but now with

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,120
the new

81
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,459
I towards this end I've is this a
problem we can move or not

82
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:07,698
I started reading the comments as well
the comment on these articles

83
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,080
to get all over the map is comments are
so many people in the comment to let the

84
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,029
guys trying to do something it obviously
ham-handed cringe-worthy even but at

85
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,659
least he's doing something

86
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,260
cut him some slack but there was another
group

87
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,829
in the comment that was unbelievably
harsh

88
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:29,819
but they weren't being harsh to macomb
they were being harsh about Lee

89
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,159
track there were people in the company
never laid eyes on the sky in their

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,090
lives

91
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:38,129
who are willing to take these obviously
an alcoholic he must be addicted to

92
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:38,730
drugs

93
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,250
he's probably a feat the people who
would the harshest

94
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,649
to the homeless guy that everyone was
talking about

95
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,909
with the people who assume that
McConnell I was going to fail it became

96
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,860
clear in a way that they wanted him to
fail

97
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,430
that whatever else he done he defended
their sense that homelessness

98
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,680
was an intractable problem

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,189
and I realized I've been reading the
criticism wrong I've been reading the

100
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,500
criticism saying

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,040
I agree with this and I don't agree with
that this one seems right that one seems

102
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,590
wrong

103
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,399
but that wasn't what mattered about the
criticism

104
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,168
what mattered about the criticism wise
is it helping

105
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:23,609
or not so many places

106
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,229
rota wrote a very thoughtful piece
criticizing work on Logan is idea if

107
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:30,779
I've saving homes left homeless by
teaching JavaScript

108
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,359
they should look we know the problem
homelessness

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,970
we know the problem the home said they
were lack homes

110
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,190
right you solve that problem with
housing first if you don't do that

111
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:47,339
nothing else woman you can have a
lottery actions that you could say

112
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,099
that interesting I didn't know about
that research I'm gonna change what I'm

113
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,919
doing

114
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:54,740
you could say I think in New York City
it's different I think for some classes

115
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,519
of homeless people are some situations
it's different

116
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,430
but almost any reaction you could have
to a glaze uses past

117
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,150
would make you smart thats

118
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:11,429
helpful critics helpful criticism said I
see what you're trying to do their

119
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,509
I don't think it's going to work becom
stand where I am

120
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,520
let me show you what the world looks
like from my point of view

121
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,639
and then there was other criticism again
Hall use

122
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,990
as harsh as the Glade as skeptical as a
glade with very different %uh

123
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,030
the tone of this criticism was corrosive
it didn't say

124
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,508
come stand where I it said stop

125
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,790
just stop what you're doing it didn't
say

126
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,729
take a different tack at the problem it
said go

127
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:47,779
a wet corrosive criticism

128
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,689
is is addressed to

129
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,719
the person solving the problem not the
problem its

130
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,720
to view listing too helpful criticism
it's not like it's all

131
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,750
happy in shining right much helpful
criticism

132
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,990
is tremendously harsh in responding to
his painful

133
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,129
but the real question is does responding
to it make you smarter

134
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,529
corrosive criticism is not like that
corrosive criticisms almost by

135
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,719
definition

136
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,539
designed not to make you smarter about
the prop

137
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:23,610
and fleeing seeing this tension between
these two kinds of criticism mccormack I

138
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,569
dot

139
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,800
there's no easy way to characterize

140
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,038
what mcconnell August trying to do with
to

141
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,348
for Leo the homeless guy

142
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,769
there some parts but they're good
they're some parts but they're bad

143
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,389
there's no simple

144
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:44,360
solution there's no point of view you
can adopt that clarifies everything

145
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,769
and I thought I recognize this this is
the sorting out time

146
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,499
I'm live to the sorting out time for two
other things one

147
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:56,199
questions of general utility of the web
and the other is

148
00:08:56,198 --> 00:09:00,448
the possibility that social media will
work in matter and spread

149
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:03,818
any generally goes like this: some new
tool comes along

150
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:07,588
and people look at think I can't do new
things with

151
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,300
right any new technology makes new
things possible

152
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:14,889
battle that's what it does it certainly
doesn't make new thing possible to

153
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,459
either not new or it's not a technology

154
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,659
when you get a new technology you don't
know how to use it so you go around

155
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:23,328
looking for places where it might fit

156
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:27,578
this is often criticized as all that
tool in search of a problem

157
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:31,558
but courses when we got hold of the web
in the early nineties nothing in the

158
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:34,639
world look like the web so we had to say
does it fit here

159
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,339
does it fit their but selling plane
tickets didn't look like the web selling

160
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,470
books didn't look like the web search
engines

161
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,600
hadn't even been thawed out yet

162
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,860
and the reaction that stuff in the
beginning is well that won't work

163
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,089
when it starts to work then react as
well that won't last

164
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,420
and then it starts the locked and the
reactors levels K

165
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,789
and then its banks but and then you get
to the sorting out time

166
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:01,448
then you get to the point where
everybody realizes this stuff

167
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:04,998
is actually embedded in what's possible
in the world

168
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,300
it happen with the web it happen with
social media

169
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:12,349
reading this thing with work on login
Leo I think it's happening now

170
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,420
with the idea Civic Media I think we're
past the point

171
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:21,399
with the easy the easy ideas in the easy
answers what characterizes the debate it

172
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,909
isn't just about finding potholes
anymore

173
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:27,178
right isn't just about adopting fire hot
right

174
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:30,578
we're stretching into the party the
system where

175
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:33,738
were actually having to figure out what
fits wear

176
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:38,329
why and that's why sorting out the
difference between helpful

177
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:43,088
and corrosive criticism matter so much

178
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,069
have to listen to the helpful critics
even if they're mean even if their harsh

179
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:50,409
even if they're angry because responding
to them

180
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:55,938
will make you smarter you can't afford
to listen to the corrosive critics

181
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:59,519
not because they're wrong they're almost
always right

182
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,499
if you wanna feel like a genius go find
some place for people trying to do

183
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,509
something new

184
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,959
and tell them that they'll fail you'll
be right

185
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,118
nine times that attack 19 times out of
20

186
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:15,778
you don't even have to understand the
problem they're working on the algorithm

187
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:17,308
is very simple

188
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:21,379
while one predict failure

189
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:27,379
you get it right most of the time it to
cheap I

190
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:31,209
but the thing the corrosive critics want
you to believe

191
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,039
is that the sentence almost nothing will
work

192
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,318
which is obviously true is the same as
the sentence

193
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:42,789
nothing will work which is completely
false

194
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:46,868
every success in human history is passed
to the eye that needle

195
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:50,800
every success in human history has
threaded its way past

196
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,159
almost nothing will work atter

197
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,759
understand where you

198
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,558
or in trying to take on a problem solved

199
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:05,448
you have to figure out what it is you're
committing yourself to

200
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:09,938
what kinda resources your marshalling
and where you fit

201
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,828
how you're taking on the problem and how
the problems

202
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:17,188
the easiest problems to take on the
great problems are just

203
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:21,238
technical probs right their problems
where you just don't have the

204
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,439
information you need

205
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:26,360
to solve the problem and if you got it
if you working on something where you

206
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,928
just need more information

207
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:31,338
and you're working with digital tools
this is paradise right

208
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,989
it's no accident that the poster child
for this kind of work in the last decade

209
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:41,528
was possible fix because there is no pro
pothole lobby you have to go up against

210
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:46,448
right maybe the mayor's brother in law
and an asphalt plant on it a little more

211
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:49,238
expensive than you like to fix the
potholes

212
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:53,239
but really the problem is just
information if I can identify where the

213
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,199
potholes or

214
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,828
I can do a better job in this is great
potholes are a problem

215
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:01,159
problems have solutions best

216
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,988
best of all possible worlds if you're
working on a technical problem

217
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:10,569
you can make rapid progress without a
lot of political issues

218
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:13,669
one up from the technical problems for
the managerial problem managerial

219
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,628
problems where there's a tension between

220
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,949
the government and what the government
is trying to do

221
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:23,878
and the citizens in with the citizens
are trying to do near very often you

222
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,149
have to negotiate things in a more
complicated way

223
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,198
right when new york city launched its
bike-sharing program put up a map it

224
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:34,258
said basically where do you want

225
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,089
there to be a bike station and of course
everybody said click I want one right by

226
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,899
my home click I want one right by work

227
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:45,159
right now this looks like the possible
problem I just help us identify street

228
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,118
corners where the things might work

229
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,428
that was the public rationale for
putting up this map we are

230
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:54,749
crowd-sourcing where the bike station
should go

231
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:59,269
the secret rationale was for people log
into the map it own mike got a lot of

232
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,139
people are excited about this bike
sharing program

233
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:07,188
right the map didn't just surface
information it legitimate and helped

234
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:09,358
create a constituency for

235
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:13,559
the bike sharing program in the first
place managerial proms are considerably

236
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:15,588
more complicated than technical problems

237
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,319
because they require not just the
information they require political will

238
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,419
they require

239
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:24,099
communication with the citizens in more
than just email us a picture of a

240
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,009
powerful

241
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:29,178
with an attached slatwall and then up
for managerial problems are political

242
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,600
props political problems with the
hardball

243
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,980
political problems where there's
disagreement even inside the government

244
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,308
as to what constitutes possible

245
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:43,149
way for is possible to imagine a city
with no piles

246
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,828
it is not possible to imagine city with
no prostitutes

247
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:52,078
to the is no way to take on da problem
with prostitution

248
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,919
because people don't even agrees to what
the goalie

249
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,229
is and I don't just mean as the left
right split

250
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,589
thats normal in american politics I mean
even within coalitions right

251
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:06,629
at the extremes to the progressive left

252
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:10,480
there are people who what sex work to
stop and there are people who want sex

253
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,249
work to become

254
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,379
a better job and there's never going to
be

255
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:18,819
any solution to that problem because the
problem

256
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:25,769
resists easy definition once your up at
the political level

257
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,318
you're not dealing with problems anymore
you're dealing with the lemmas

258
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:32,808
and you don't have solutions you only
have trade-offs and you have to

259
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:33,789
understand

260
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,958
what the trade-offs or

261
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,768
so if people what to distract you

262
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:45,589
as they want to distract you when ever
anybody tries

263
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,799
anything new someone will try to
distract

264
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:53,970
easiest way to do that is to intimate
that the problem you're working on is

265
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,980
not the real problem

266
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,609
if you're working on a technical problem
if you said I just I have to get more

267
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:01,350
information to solve this problem

268
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,319
I can come in and say well you working
on potholes what you really need to be

269
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,088
working on improving traffic flow
citywide

270
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,220
but your little thing isn't gonna thank
and if you're taking on a giant

271
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,980
political problem

272
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,769
like increase the traffic flow citywide
I can come in if that's totally

273
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,789
impractical you should be working on the
part

274
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:25,509
I can always distract you by intimating
that the level you're working at is the

275
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:26,499
wrong

276
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:31,540
level to be working one of the reasons
you have to understand

277
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:35,719
what it is you're trying to do is to
keep from getting distracted with either

278
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,410
larger scale or smaller scale problems

279
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:41,600
you also have to understand where you
fit are you just trying to gather

280
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,528
information

281
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,668
are you trying to bridge the gap between
the citizens in the government are you

282
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:49,489
actually trying to hash out some fight

283
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:54,389
inside the government and those laugh
problems the political problem so hard

284
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,730
to follow to think that as an example

285
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,688
right shared citizen budgeting the
porter Allegri process

286
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,889
right has been a Rand and
well-documented

287
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,959
and works and has good effect in yet it
spread

288
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,839
verrrrry very slowly because anything
that touches the political party the

289
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,059
process

290
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:18,019
is really hard to change

291
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,059
in all of this matters

292
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,659
this sorting out of the helpful from the
corrosive criticism and knowing which

293
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,380
level the problem you're trying to take
all

294
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,520
because the most important resource

295
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,759
you've got is it

296
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,019
strategy are you planning your tactics
is not your tools or your technology

297
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:44,539
your project management the most
important resource you've got

298
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,079
your own ability to change

299
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,179
your mind that's what matters

300
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,200
over the long haul so

301
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,819
as I was getting on the plane to come
here yesterday I got a funny

302
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,009
piece of news WEA the homeless guy

303
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:07,180
with the laptop in the job script books
got arrested yesterday morning

304
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,529
and why people do off the bench in took
in downtown

305
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:14,490
arrested him for sleep in the park
because he doesn't have any place to go

306
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,019
home

307
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,109
and come on shows up to their usual
meeting spot yesterday morning

308
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:22,689
Celia gone sees the coffee cups of
coffee cup kicked over

309
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,019
realizes what happened goes to a nearby
traffic upset the guy

310
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,109
that sit on a bench right there did you
see where he went traffic up to the I

311
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,529
got arrested

312
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,470
& Co log goes down 10

313
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,299
and tries to get Leah bailed out of jail
and try to get his laptop which has been

314
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,480
confiscated back

315
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,759
that still going on now there's no
resolution that leo's

316
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,829
still incarcerated his laptop is still

317
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:50,519
in police possession but kongers work

318
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,759
and this may work right mccormack has an
enormous amount of resources at his

319
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,879
disposal

320
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,540
I they've got 100 media attention now in
part because the car for further

321
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,099
mcconnell kicked off a couple of months
ago

322
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:07,179
two things go well for Leo it's not
going to be because this is a general

323
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,009
solution to some sort of

324
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:12,710
problem of homelessness it'll be this
will be a fairy godparents story

325
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,549
right because tim allen's point out
fairy godparents downscale

326
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:20,069
but thats that's not I think the
important part of the story the

327
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,470
important part of the story is

328
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,240
the colon went from being a guy who felt
comfortable characterizing people as the

329
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,000
justly and unjustly home

330
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,059
guy who felt comfortable hawking about
the homeless without even bothering to

331
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,019
learn

332
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,039
the name of the person he was tired
heater from that guy

333
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,139
into a guy who takes time out of a work
day to try and get his friend bailed out

334
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,009
of jail I'll tell you as a new yorker

335
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:49,240
nobody voluntarily interacts with the
NYPD

336
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,210
right that's a big change

337
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,529
and it may not matter in the long term
this may just turn out to be a story

338
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,960
that macaan like tells his friends next
time is on the boat about this one time

339
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,509
he did this one thing

340
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:06,450
that can certainly happen what is clear
them a common would not have learned

341
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,750
what he's learned

342
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,119
about the problems with homelessness the
problems the homeless face

343
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,579
if it hadn't started out with the wrong
idea

344
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:20,710
and been willing to test it in the world
it's not the people who do nothing

345
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,500
who learn new things and that

346
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,279
that possibility the possibility of a
learning

347
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,940
as you go that's the essential resource

348
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,730
in this room government get this wrong

349
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,110
all the time government almost designed
to get this wrong government said

350
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:45,229
we had that big project we did all that
planning it didn't go well

351
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,000
I know next time we'll just plan harder

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,380
right you can't just plan harder and get
where you need to go you can't

353
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,920
get a rocket to the moon by just aiming
better

354
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,640
at launch you have to start with course
correction

355
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,920
the other extreme doesn't work either
the people who say I know will have a

356
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,720
hackathon

357
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,839
unconference in will develop a solution

358
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:15,509
I'm that doesn't work either hackathons
don't

359
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,440
come up with solutions pack up and come
up with a kind hand waving national

360
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
you can do in a day and a half right

361
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,140
the output a hackathon isn't

362
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,150
a solution output a hacker fight is a
better understanding a problem the

363
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,340
product at the hackathon

364
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,549
isn't running code it's the social
capital developed

365
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:41,389
among the people in the room

366
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,400
so we've all gone school people in my
tribe have all gone to school on the new

367
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,009
PD a story

368
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:50,119
we all know NUPEDIA a failed because they
were so process heavy is anybody's ever

369
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,819
been a bureaucracy knows

370
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:56,710
when you have a seven-step process for
developing something as new PD ahead

371
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,440
what you have severin different places
where things can grind

372
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,799
to complete hot right and we learned

373
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:07,779
that story but there's a deeper story
there

374
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:13,250
right which is this the people who made
new PD a fail

375
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,500
with the people who made Wikipedia
succeed

376
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,650
when sanger needed people to try out his
wiki he didn't go out to the public

377
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,100
Internet

378
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:26,490
say come one come all it's trying to
stay he went to the people who worked

379
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,549
with him for nine much trying to build
encyclopedia different way

380
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,009
and he relied on those people had a
build up enough trust

381
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,400
and enough the sensibility of what their
goal were that they were willing to try

382
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,170
something new

383
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,710
and he didn't go to them with a big
promise that this weekly thing was gonna

384
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,569
be

385
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:46,710
the victory he went to them

386
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,569
having hit he went to the very modestly
he said

387
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,799
look this may not work humor me

388
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,059
go there try it will pick you all up
five minutes

389
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:02,740
the output have NUPEDIA it wasn't a
failed encyclopedia dead URL be

390
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,120
output have NUPEDIA with the people
willing to try something else

391
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,559
week EP via the most widely used
encyclopedia in the history

392
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,990
up the world his plan B

393
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,400
that ability the ability to build up
among a group of people

394
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,440
a set up trust a center focus so that
they can try something new is very

395
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,960
often the critical output

396
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,819
that may not be you when you design a
project your plan a may work correct

397
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:40,929
it happen sometimes but it's not the
normal case

398
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,480
and as you're setting out to do whatever
it is you want to do or for those of you

399
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,150
who have been through this process as
you've done

400
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,990
whatever you've done important thing to
recognize is

401
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,880
you were building up your own ability

402
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,050
to understand the problem whatever else
happens when you set out

403
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,149
that's the precious resource while the
best hardware

404
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,769
hardware prototype is I've ever known
better data piana tell it came to visit

405
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,529
one my class

406
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:12,779
and she said I used to think I would
build the first prototype to show the

407
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,029
client

408
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,829
a solution to their problems but I've
come to realize that you build the first

409
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:18,720
prototype

410
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,990
to show the client that they don't yet
understand

411
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,519
the problem right very often you don't
get people to even tell you what it is

412
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,160
that they need

413
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,360
and tell you can show them something
that is concrete Lee wrong

414
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:38,169
that that ability the ability to say

415
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,110
we're doing all the planning we can
we're learning everything about the

416
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:44,829
problem we can we're heading off in this
direction

417
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:49,059
is used you have to do that but you also
have to say

418
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,309
were also setting out with the sense
that

419
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:56,839
we're the important resource the people
working on this in our ability to learn

420
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:00,779
from this and change our minds

421
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,950
is what's gonna make or break this over
the long haul because

422
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,100
across the history of large successful
projects

423
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:12,159
almost nothing ended up the way it
started out

424
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,550
when you look at the group that made
things work what you see is that it

425
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:16,210
isn't

426
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,430
it is how they it is what they did first

427
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,710
that mattered was what they did next

428
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,519
so thank you all and good luck
