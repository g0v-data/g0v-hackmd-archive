### Title: 

5 Years Facing the Ocean: Advancing Rights to Information, Gender Equality, Youth Engagement in East-Asia (15 words)

### Description

Since 2019, participants and members of civic hacking communities in Japan (Code for Japan), Korea (Code for Korea), and Taiwan (g0v.tw)  have been organizing the Facing the Ocean (FtO) regional network. Presenters from each community will share the inception of the network, its organizational scheme, as well as key moments and projects using tech and collaboration to address communinal, national, and regional issues.

This session will present how it connects civic tech projects in East Asia advancing rights on information accessibility and integrity, gender equality, and youth engagement, working against government suppression, authoritarian interference, and (physical) cultural divides in our region.

Examples include an anti-extradition law portal (2019), COVID-19 dashboards (2020-2021), community fact-checking (2019-now), AI-assisted open parliament websites (2023-now), women and LGBTQ rights tracker (since 2019), and joint student engagement inspiring the next generation of the civic hacking movement (2023-now).

Presenters will then share preliminary cross-country comparisons among Japan, Korea, and Taiwan based on Facing the Ocean project outcomes and community feedback.

Slido will be used to collect questions and feedback during sharing. A facilitated open discussion will follow. A shared document will be used throughout the session to create meeting notes and formulate future collaboration.

### Description

Since 2019, participants and members of civic hacking communities in Taiwan (g0v.tw), Japan (Code for Japan), and Korea (Code for Korea) have been organizing the Facing the Ocean regional network. Three presenters will share the inception of the network, its organizational scheme, as well as key moments and projects using tech and collaboration to address communinal, national, and regional issues.

This session will focus on the issue of information accessbility and integrity. Presenters will highlight such projects and efforts connected by the Facing the Ocean network, working against government suppression, authoritarian interference, and (physical) cultural divides in East Asia.

Examples include an anti-extradition law portal (2019), COVID-19 dashboards (2020-2021), community fact-checking (and its dissolution in Korea), data-driven projects countering misinformation (2023), and AI-assisted open parliament (2023).

Presenters will then share a preliminary country comparison of information accessibility and integrity among East Asian countries based on an open dataset of the aforementioned projects, other related efforts, and recent developments in the region.

Slido will be used to collect questions and feedback during sharing. An facilitated open discussion will follow. A shared document will be used throughout the session to create meeting notes and formulate future collaboration.
