A car pre purchase inspection or pre inspection car check involves examining the mechanical, electrical, and visual aspects of a car before you buy it. Experts assess key parts like the engine, transmission, suspension, brakes, and tires. They even inspect smaller things like the air conditioning and electrical functions.

In Dubai, the scorching heat, tough road conditions, and lots of stop-and-go traffic take a toll on cars. Getting an inspection done becomes super important. It’s not only about noticing what’s clearly broken or worn out—it’s about catching hidden issues that might drain your wallet later.
