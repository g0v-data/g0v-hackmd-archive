## Your Name:
- g0v jothon (jothon-organizer@g0v.tw)
- g0v international (g0v-intl@googlegroups.com)

## Title of your project:
g0v.tw civic tech community

## Briefly describe your project:
g0v (pronounced “gov zero”) is a decentralized, grass-roots civic tech community based in Taiwan. We advocate information transparency and build solutions to promote civic engagement & participation. The co-founders of g0v held the first g0v-style hackthon in 2012. After seven years’ evolution, g0v has attained an robust approach to collaborate. It is now a strong network that connects citizens of different backgrounds from local and global.

> 是 7 年！ [name=bess]

### ‣ Building Local community

Built on the spirits of open source and activism, g0v aims to use technology in the interest of the public good. Our missions are to provide citizens easy access to public information and to empower them to make a change. Substituting the “o” with “0″ in gov, we want to use the power of digital technologies to reform current politics so as to envision a new future of democracy.

### ‣ International outreach
Established in 2012, g0v has since hosted more than 50 hackthons and three international summits. Thousands of participants from different backgrounds have contributed to hundreds of projects, making g0v one of the biggest civic tech communities around the world. g0v is an active member of Code for All, an international network of civic tech organizations.

## Date and Duration of your project：
Since 2012 to present.

## What is the positive impact your project seeks to create?

### [1] Culture of Collaboration:
The g0v contributors are coders, designers, activists, educators, writers and citizens from across Taiwan and even overseas. By adopting technical and legal tools for collaboration, such as github, hackmd, CC license and open source license, the g0v community promote the culture of collaboration. In the past seven years, there are more than 550 proposals and more than 3000 contributors working together.

### [2] Freedom of Speech and Information Transparency:

Built on the spirit of the open-source community, g0v stands for freedom of speech and information transparency. Applying technology in the interest of the public good, allowing citizens easy access to vital information. Providing the society with closer view at politics and important issues. People can  evaluate their government and exert their democratic right to make influence of politicians's act.

### [3] Independent and Transparent:

We cooperate through our website, g0v.tw, and through open platforms, such as IRC, hackmd and github, among others. Our work is also done through open events, such as our “hackathons”. The output of g0v, including source code, documents, formulas, analyses and processes, is open for anyone to view, react, use, and improve.

### [4] Sanguine on Fostering Change:

g0v as a community of enthusiasts, we love to seek out problems and explore solutions. Furthermore, we are willing to take action to implement these solutions. Through various types of cooperation, we enhance the impact and the creativity of our ideas. We aim to bring about change and are not willing to resort to cynicism or apathy. The task forces of g0v seek different approaches to empower the whole community, such as “g0v Civic Tech Prototype Grant” which supported 24 projects with total of 400,000 USD since 2017.

### [5] Open governace:
g0v.tw is a multi-centered community, there are many different projects as well as task forces aiming on building a more vibrant open source, open governance ecosystem.
