# Top Front-end Frameworks in 2024
With optimal performance and safety aims, Rust is increasingly utilized in website creation, including the front end. The landscape is mainly occupied by JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular; however, contrary to their dominance, there are also various Rust-based front-end frameworks. The high performance levels they boast of, together with their strong typing capacities and memory safety guarantees make them an excellent choice for constructing contemporary web apps.

In the year 2024, various Rust front-end frameworks have distinct features and capabilities. The article highlights several Rust front-end frameworks specifically Yew, Seed, Percy, Sauron, and Dioxus. Developers need to select among these tools as per their requirements thus the article provides an elaborate comparison of these frameworks including their strengths weaknesses and use cases. Furthermore, we will address how front-end developers can incorporate this framework with already existing tools and enhance performance in web applications.

## Yew
You can build modern web apps with Yew, which is a framework based on components and was inspired by JavaScript frameworks such as React. This framework allows you to create dynamic, responsive and fast front-end web applications in an easy way.

### Strengths
Yew’s framework resembles that of React thus allowing developers accustomed to developing based on components to easily switch over. They embrace logic, rendering as well as states doing away with repetitive codes and achieving modularity within them. App speed and efficacy are guaranteed thanks to Rust’s compile-time optimizations together with its memory management practices. The framework employs Shallow and Tall structures that are similar to Rust's zero-cost abstractions alongside its powerful concurrency model to come out with very effective web applications. Yew also has Rust’s strong typing system which oversees many errors at compilation time thus lowering the odds of running time bugs hence more dependable and easy to maintain code results from this twist in operations.

Even if Yew’s ecosystem is smaller than that of JavaScript, it keeps growing at a steady pace. There are several types of libraries and tools within it that make things easier during the development process; for instance, routing, state management, and component libraries. One of the best things about Yew applications is that they compile to WebAssembly so that they can be executed in browsers almost as fast as native code would be executed. Because of this reason, Yew can also be used for applications where performance is crucial.

### Limitations
Yew has a smaller community in comparison with JavaScript frameworks. Fewer third-party libraries, plugins, and community-driven resources such as tutorials and forums may come from this. Developers who are just starting to use Rust may find it difficult due to its learning curve. To use Yew effectively, one must understand Rust’s ownership model, borrowing and lifetimes. However, the tooling and ecosystem surrounding Yew are less developed than those for javascript frameworks. This might imply that there are not many out-of-the-box solutions provided for standard operations.

### Use Cases
SPAs or Single-Page Applications are best suited for Yew, which allows loading of dynamic content without refreshing the entire page. Its component-based structure aids in handling the complexities of large applications better. Additionally, Yew creates highly interactive GUIs that demand in-time updates through user actions; thus providing a smooth browsing experience because of its performance benefits over other web technologies. The efficiency and performance of Yew are suitable for applications that require real-time data updates such as chat applications or live dashboards.

### Front-end Utilization
Yew can develop web applications that are dynamic in structure and syntax like React. By defining reusable components, application states can be managed, while user interactions are dealt with effectively by software engineers. In addition, Yew has built-in support for state management within components and can work with external libraries dedicated to the same purpose. In this way large applications can implement complex state handling techniques through its API calls , hence supporting client-side routing which enables developers create single page websites with several views depending on what they want at any time hence creating modern websites that have smooth browsing experience.

### Example Code
Let us look at a simple example to illustrate how Yew can be used to build a basic counter application:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

struct Model {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    value: i32,
}

enum Msg {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}

impl Component for Model {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self { link, value: 0 }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Increment => self.value += 1,
            Msg::Decrement => self.value -= 1,
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::Increment)>{ "+1" }</button>
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::Decrement)>{ "-1" }</button>
                <p>{ self.value }</p>
            </div>
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<Model>();
}
```
This piece of code represents a Yew application that counts. The link that holds the message to be sent and maintains the counter's value, is included in the primary parts of this program known as `Model struct`. The possible messages according to `Msg enum` are Increment and Decrement that work on the counter’s value. The Component trait is implemented for Model, which has methods for creating, updating messages, changing properties, and viewing. In the `view` method, there are buttons that increase or decrease the counter and one paragraph that shows its current value written in HTML format. The `main` function mounts a component of Model to the `DOM` at first to start off its execution.

### Comparison with React
Yew framework implemented in Rust looks like similar thing, which is in JavaScript called React. Both have component-based architecture that incorporates state management as well as event handling. In Yew, it is the Model struct and Component trait that deal with state and rendering respectively; in React there are classes or functional components using hooks like `useState` to manage state. For example, sending messages (i.e., `Msg enum`) would correspond to event handlers found in React. The rendering logic in Yew’s `view()` method bears resemblance with React’s `render()` or `return` statements found in functional components. Lastly, both frameworks make use of virtual DOMs for efficient updates where Yew compiles into WebAssembly so as to achieve the wanted performance levels.

Yew can be seen as a better option than conventional JavaScript frameworks in case of front-end development. Featuring architecture based on components, high performance and strong typing – Yew revels itself in developing modern web applications. Despite existing challenges like lesser community and demanding learning curve; advantages of having rust in front end programming usually justify them for numerous projects.

## Seed
Seed is a Rust front-end scaffold that favors non-typed methods and has little preliminary text, thus being a compatible focus for creators valuing on safety of types or simplicity. With the help of this mighty structure made of types that Rust has got, it becomes possible to notice numerous faults during compilation which reduces the number of errors appearing during execution process and results in much trustable code. This framework’s intention is to reduce any extra information in order to achieve a neat and direct programming interface which assists users develop their applications without slowing down.

### Strengths
For Rust, Seed is a frontend framework that is different from others because of its strong typing and little overhead code. Seed catches bugs early thus ensuring low chances of runtime errors this increases its reliability and maintainability and minimizes possible runtime code problems. The structure of the API has clear and short entries which can speed up programming significantly. Additionally, Seed fits right into the Rust environment thereby enabling developers to use known instruments and libraries.

### Limitations
Despite its strong points, Seed is not as advanced as other frameworks like Yew. This immaturity translates into a smaller environment for it; consequently, there are fewer third-party libraries and devices for Seed. This may constrain its usability in the case of larger and more complicated projects that require substantial third-party support most of the time. The community around this particular framework is also smaller thereby leading to fewer resources, guides, and community-based assistance.

###  Use Cases
Single-page applications (SPAs) and other web apps that put a premium on type safety and low boilerplate best suit Seed. Simple and maintainable small to medium-sized projects are where it shines most. Developers who need to create stable applications in a fast and efficient way can use this framework since it is designed for it, therefore taking advantage of Rust’s safety features as well as its performance capabilities. In cases where reducing complexity and improving code quality are necessary, Seed is especially advantageous.

### Example Code
Let us look at a simple counter application example using Seed:
```rust
use seed::{prelude::*, *};

struct Model {
    counter: i32,
}

enum Msg {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}

fn update(msg: Msg, model: &mut Model, _: &mut Orders<Msg>) {
    match msg {
        Msg::Increment => model.counter += 1,
        Msg::Decrement => model.counter -= 1,
    }
}

fn view(model: &Model) -> Node<Msg> {
    div![
        button![ev(Ev::Click, |_| Msg::Increment), "+1"],
        button![ev(Ev::Click, |_| Msg::Decrement), "-1"],
        p![model.counter]
    ]
}

#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub fn start() {
    App::start("app", init, update, view);
}

fn init(_: Url, _: &mut impl Orders<Msg>) -> Model {
    Model { counter: 0 }
}
```
The given code snippet is a basic counter application in the Seed framework for Rust. The Model struct contains the application’s state, which contains only one field, `counter`, that denotes the current count. The Msg enum consists of two messages, Increment and Decrement used to alter the value of the counter. The `update` function takes a message, the current model state, and a list of orders (side effects can be performed using them). It identifies the content of the message and changes the model’s counter as needed. For instance, when incrementing the counter by one in response to an Increment message sent, but decrementing it by one in response to a Decrement one.

The `view` function is what gives the application its HTML structure. It does this by creating a `div` element that has two buttons and a paragraph. The first button sends an Increment message while the second button sends a Decrement message when it is clicked. In addition to this, a paragraph displays the current value of the counter.  The Seed application is initialized by the `start` function. It mounts the app to the `DOM` element whose ID is "app" using the `App::start` function. This function requires `init`, `update` function and `view` function as arguments. The model is initialized by `init` function with counter at zero.

### Comparison with Javascript
The Seed framework has an architecture driven by components, just like javascript(script language) frameworks such as React, hence their commonality. In the same way that a React component maintains its state and responds to user actions through event handlers, so does a Seed component manage its states modifications and those events using function calls as well as messages.

Employing JavaScript, React utilizes either hooks or class-based means for handling state and side effects, whereas Seed makes use of Rust’s strong typing and message-based systems in dealing with updates on states as well as rendering. Although both frameworks depend on a virtual DOM to speedily alter user interface, Seed’s virtual DOM implementation was specifically adjusted for Rust and WebAssembly that resulted in increases in efficiency and guarantee of type safety.

A noticeable difference is in the type system: While Seed utilizes Rust’s powerful type checking that aids in catching errors before happening as well as making a strong robust code, JavaScript frameworks such as React depend on dynamic typing that can cause runtime errors. In addition, Seed applications are compiled into WebAssembly hence able to be executed at almost the same speed as native execution within browsers while React apps execute straight away using JavaScript language itself.

When we talk about community and ecosystem, React is the framework that possesses advanced and vast ecosystem comprising numerous third party libraries, tools as well as community resources. Seed on the other hand, being newer and less common has limited set of resources available in its ecosystem. This means that while working with Seed it’s possible for you not to find quite a number of plugins or support mechanisms as compared to the already established javascript frameworks.

Generally speaking, notwithstanding the uncanny resemblance existing between Seed and React among other Javascript frameworks, they differ in several aspects such as the technology they are based on, their type systems and ecosystems; thus providing developers with unique benefits and considerations.
