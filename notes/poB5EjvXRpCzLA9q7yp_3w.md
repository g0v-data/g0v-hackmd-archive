No doubt, a car needs engine oil for lubrication so you can accelerate. Transmission fluid is necessary to automate the gear shifts.  However, if your vehicle has a hydraulic brake system, you may also require brake fluid.

The brake fluid has the responsibility to generate enough pressure so that brake pads can work properly and the vehicle can get stopped as expected. When you step on the brake pedal, pressure from the brake fluid is generated to press the brake pads, which in turn stop your wheels from turning.

So brake fluid is an important component, and if it goes low, you cannot stop the vehicle properly.  Your car might behave out of control just because of the scarcity of brake fluid. However, it is necessary to understand the reason behind the low level of brake fluid.

Sensors are an integral part of most vehicles. The braking system does not take too much time to generate indications once the sensor senses any problem. When the brake fluid level is low, the brake light usually begins to illuminate.
