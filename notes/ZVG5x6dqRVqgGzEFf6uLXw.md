g0v.tw is a civic  tech community in Taiwan  since 2012 with deep open-source roots.  With 1,000+ contributors through  40+ hackathons, it is  [recognized](http://sbaack.com/2015/11/19/scraping-the-global-civic-tech-community-on-github-part-2.html) as one of the largest group in the global civic tech community. The community focuses on building tools for better information disclosure, engagement,  and online democracy, advocating government transparency through the power of information technology.

Through the years, the g0v community  stimulated the progress of open government, open data, civic participation, and new media in Taiwan. Today the open community is still one of the main driving force for grass root civic movements, through  interdisciplinary collaboration.

> As of today, we already conducted 40+ hackathons, 50+ invited talks, brought 80+ media mentions, and more than 1000+ contributors throughout the globe, with all of the products released under the free software model. We've previously held the first g0v Summit in October 2014, then in August 2015, d|Bootcamp Taipei, a series of courses on the data journalism partnering with the World Bank Group.

[g0v.tw](http://g0v.tw/) 台灣零時政府社群從 2012 年 10 月開始，用數位世代的思維，以開源（open source）方式號召群眾以網路世代的新模式協作，運用科技力量促進政府透明化。截至 2016 年 3 月已有 40+ 場黑客松、受邀演講 50+ 場、媒體報導 80+ 次、1000+ 遍佈三大洲的貢獻者，成果皆以自由軟體模式釋出。 並於 2014 年 11 月舉辦 g0v Summit 零時政府高峰會（g0v Summit 2014），2015 年 8 月與世界銀行集團合作舉辦資料新聞實戰營（d|Bootcamp Taipei）。

三年多來 g0v 社群的開源群眾貢獻刺激了台灣開放政府、開放資料、公民參與、新媒體等領域的發展，直至今日仍是數位草根公民運動的重要動力。g0v 社群以強勁的跨界動能拓展各種成果，在國際公民科技（civic tech）社群也受到矚目，並迅速成為全球最大開源開放政府社群。

### About g0v summit 2016


2014 年底台灣歷經了大型公民運動的洗禮，g0v 社群首度舉辦 g0v Summit 高峰會，促成開放社群、政府、NGO、學術圈、網路界多方交流。是台灣各界摸索如何運用資訊科技與群眾參與尋找新路的一次盛會，也邀請到國際公民科技界重量級先驅來台分享。當時兩天的密集議程碰撞出許多跨界火花，也在社群持續運動中，延燒出新的協作成果。

During 2016, the time of the presidential transition in Taiwan, the g0v community wants to call for talents from different sectors and find a way to change the society through the use of technology.

台灣在 2016 年時值新舊政府交接，g0v 社群秉持熱愛開放分享的精神，也希望再度邀集各界齊聚，找出運用科技改變社會的下一步。

> We hope to provide a platform for civic groups, tech savvies, and the government to communicate, making changes for a better tomorrow.

### Previous Highlights


Throughout the years, the g0v community has been building civic tech tools for better information disclosure, open data engagement, and online democracy, meanwhile being an strong influence on the advocacy of Taiwan's open government policy.
Since the 2014 Summit, there are some exciting achievements of collaboration between the government agencies, media, and NGOs and civic tech communities in Taiwan, especially the g0v community.

- Taiwan topped the OKFN Open Data Index in 2015 as the vibrant communities push for open government data, but more importantly the Open-Definition-compliant Open Government Data License was enacted, which was also drafted in the community.
- The NGO alliance for constitution reform proposed several projects in the hackathon for people to better understand the issue.
- Minister Tsai, who spoke at the last summit, proposed a consultation platform focused on digital regulations in a hackathon which turned into the vtaiwan platform.
- During the dust explosion accident, the civic tech community mobilized and work with the official emergency response team to provide timely information, and started regular digital disaster response drills.

In November 2014, the first g0v summit was held by volunteers from the g0v community. Individuals and groups interested in “technically” revolutionize the society were invited to join the discussion, forming the momentum of impact through in-depth communications.

### g0v Community Results
