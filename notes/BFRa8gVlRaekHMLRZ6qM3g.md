# User Module Handover Documentation

## Overview
This module is responsible for user management, including registration and retrieval of user details. The primary components include:
- `UserController`: Exposes RESTful API endpoints.
- `UserService`: Handles core business logic.
- `UserRepository`: Manages database interactions.

---

## API Documentation: UserController

### `/api/users/register`
- **HTTP Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Registers a new user. Checks if the user already exists, encrypts the password, and saves the user to the database.
- **Request Body**:
  - **`UserRequest`**: Contains user credentials.
    - `username` (String) - *Required*, unique username.
    - `password` (String) - *Required*, encrypted on the server.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Validates if the username is already in use through `UserService.registerUser`.
  - Encrypts the password using `BCrypt` (encryption located in `encryptPassword` method within `UserService`).
- **Response**:
  - **Success**: Returns `201` with `UserResponse` (contains `id` and `username`).
  - **Failure**: Returns error message with `400` if username already exists (`UserAlreadyExistsException`).

### `/api/users/{id}`
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Retrieves user information based on the provided ID.
- **Path Parameter**:
  - `id` (Long) - *Required*, unique identifier for the user.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Calls `UserService.getUserById`. Throws `UserNotFoundException` if the user is not found.
- **Response**:
  - **Success**: Returns `200` with `UserResponse`.
  - **Failure**: Returns `404` if the user does not exist (`UserNotFoundException`).

## Service Layer Documentation: UserService

### `registerUser`
- **Description**: Handles user registration process.
- **Core Logic**:
  1. Checks if the username already exists in the database.
  2. Encrypts the password using `BCrypt`.
  3. Saves the user data to the database.
- **Method Details**:
  - `encryptPassword(String password)`: Uses `BCrypt` to hash the password. For future changes to encryption, adjust this method.
- **Return**: `UserResponse` with user ID and username.
- **Expansion and Maintenance Suggestions**:
  - **User Roles**: Consider adding a `role` attribute to `User` if role-based access control is required.
  - **Security**: For higher security, consider additional encryption layers within `encryptPassword`.
  - **Distributed Systems**: For a distributed environment, ensure unique constraints on username to handle duplicate requests gracefully.

### `getUserById`
- **Description**: Fetches user data based on ID, returns basic user information.
- **Logic Details**:
  1. Queries the database for user by ID.
  2. If not found, throws `UserNotFoundException`.
- **Return**: `UserResponse` with user ID and username.
- **Expansion and Maintenance Suggestions**:
  - **Performance**: Use Redis or caching to optimize response time, especially under high request volumes.
  - **Additional User Details**: If required, update `UserResponse` to include new attributes or create a new response object.

## Database Design and Configuration Suggestions

**User Table Structure**:
- **Columns**:
  - `id` (Long) - Primary key, auto-incremented.
  - `username` (String) - Unique, indexed.
  - `password` (String) - Encrypted password storage.
- **Design Considerations**:
  - **Indexing**: Ensure `username` is indexed for optimal query performance.
  - **Encryption**: Password encryption should balance performance and security. Future upgrades to encryption methods should be carefully tested.

## System Configuration and Security Recommendations

- **Password Encryption**: Currently using `BCrypt`. Consider version upgrades or stronger encryption for improved security.
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions (`UserNotFoundException`, `UserAlreadyExistsException`) return standardized HTTP codes (404, 400). Additional error codes can be added to `GlobalExceptionHandler` as needed.

## Handover Notes

1. **User Registration Flow**:
   - `UserController` and `UserService` handle registration directly.
   - For data validation (e.g., email format), consider using `Spring Validation` or custom validation methods.

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding JWT authentication if more robust API security is required.
   - Password storage and encryption can be moved to a separate security module if scaling is anticipated.

3. **Common Issues & Troubleshooting**:
   - **Slow User Query**: If queries are slow, check database indexing or implement caching in `getUserById`.
   - **Password Encryption Performance**: Ensure encryption is efficient under load; `BCrypt` settings may require tuning.
