Skin collecting has become my main hobby outside of actually playing CS. I started small with cheaper items but gradually worked my way up to more expensive pieces. The AK-47 is probably the most important weapon to have a good skin for since you use it so often in matches. I've been researching different options and patterns for weeks now. Found some really nice examples at https://dmarket.com/csgo-skins/product-card/ak-47-gold-arabesque that caught my attention because of the detailed artwork and gold accents. The condition and float value really matter when you're investing in premium skins like this. It's not just about how it looks but also about maintaining or increasing value over time if you decide to trade later
