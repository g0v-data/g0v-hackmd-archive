TI local chapters are independent
developed locally

civic society can only do a pilot project, gov takes over later

### Diana

### Vietnam
social mvmt repressed in authoritarian countries

TI can't really work explicitly
so work as indv and build trust with key activists
written guidance
circulate online in a very careful way (physical danger)

"local special bodies"
school boards...

place-based strategies
