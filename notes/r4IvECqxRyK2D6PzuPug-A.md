### We come from everywhere
g0v is a community of open collaboration. We the g0v contributors are from everywhere. We are software developers, designers, activists, educators, writers, citizens and netizens of every profession. We gather in the hope to improve Taiwan’s civil society through technology and collaboration. If you’re willing to contribute your skills and expertise, you can take part in g0v.

### We are a polycentric community of self-organized contributors
g0v projects are self-initiated and self-organized. With this Manifesto as the base of consensus, every g0v project makes its own decisions on its operation and governance. The g0v community is made out of these self-governing projects. There is no single center or representative of g0v.

### We are citizens collaborating to bring about change
Starting from the open-source movement, g0v is an active citizen of Taiwan. We the g0v contributors support freedom of speech and information transparency. By providing digestible information and hands-on digital tools, we the g0v contributors bring more citizens to participate in public issues and influence government actions.

### We live open-source
We the g0v contributors communicate and collaborate online, while convene and connect in hackathons offline. Project outcomes (including but not limited to text, images, code, data, analysis, and processes) are open-source, allowing more people to use, improve, comment, and maximize their usage.

### We have fun and want to change the status quo
We the g0v contributors love to dig into problems, and we take pleasure in finding solutions and taking action to make a change. We connect different expertise to amplify our collective force. Guided by imagination, we collaborate and explore new frontiers. We act to change the status quo. We refuse to be silent accomplices.

### We are you
g0v is a non-partisan, not-for-profit, grassroots movement. You can contribute to projects with your brain or your muscle. You can also be a sponsor for g0v hackathons or specific projects. If you like what you’ve read, get involved with g0v. Share your project ideas and your aspiration about a world renewed. Join us to change our society for the better.
