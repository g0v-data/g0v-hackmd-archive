Questions for an article 
Hello,
My name is RÃ©my Bourdillon and I am a journalist living in Taiwan. Not sure to understand how this system works, but I'm trying...
I am writing an article about the management of the pandemic in Taiwan, for one of the main French language newspapers in Canada, called Le Devoir. I would have some questions about g0v projects. So I post them here?
Thank you for your answers!
