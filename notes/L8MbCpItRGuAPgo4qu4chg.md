### 6:13 - 6:52

That's way it's very interesting. Because all these movements, big movements that try to change the situation.
People always think that it should happen in countries with big problem, with huge problems, social problems, economy problems, and poor countries, things like this, it can never happen in countries where you don't see these problems.
For example, when the Spring happened in Africa, what we were thinking was "this cannot happen in our country", is we understand what is happening in all these poor countries in Africa, because you know they are poor, .. everything is horrible.

很有趣，因為人們總覺得，這些想要改變現況的大型運動，只會發生在「有大問題的國家」：巨大的問題、社會問題、經濟問題、貧窮國家，等等。而不會發生在「你沒看到有這麼多慘況的地方」。

例如阿拉伯之春在非洲爆發時，我們當時所想的是「這不會發生在我們的國家」，我們知道這間巨大的事情發生了，但是我們認為是因為在非洲，很貧困，... 有很多問題，等等。

### ==\*\* 6:52 - 7:00 **==

But you know we are in Europe, this is different, and this is not going to happen. And then, bomb! Happened. And this is exactly, what happen in every country.

—— 但，我們在歐洲，一切是不一樣的，這樣的運動很難發生。然後，「碰！」，（西班牙 15M）運動就發生了。

而且這也正是在其他國家發生的狀況。

### 7:15 - 7:42

And, always, in every country, people were thinking, "This cannot happen here", "This country is not in such a bad situation", "People don't care about politics", "People don't want to change things". Always the same senses. And then, "bomb", it was an explosion, a massive explosion, with huge part of the population.

And it was a wonderful discovery, because it tells us that it will happen the same, in all the countries.

在每個國家的人民們總想著：「這不會發生在這裡」「這個國家還沒有糟到這個程度」「人們根本不關心政治」「人們不想改變」⋯⋯等等，（原本）都是這樣的想法，然後，
「碰！」，運動爆發了，並且是大型的、有大量人們參與的社會運動。

這是一個很美好的發現，因為它告訴我們，在所有的國家，（改變）都會發生。


### 9:36 - 10:12

And the first idea was clearly, "Not to do a political party".
People understood from the very beginning, that the elections the political party systems, is a very special kind of game, where is very difficult to win, and not because of good reasons. It is built in a way that only, ..., you can win with lot of support, broad media, ... a lot of things, and has nothing to do with thinking about the country, and thinking about politics.

（在運動的一開始），「不要組成一個政治政黨」這樣的理念是很清楚的。
人們在一開始就理解到，（現有的）選舉、政黨系統，是一個非常特殊的遊戲，你很難贏，而且不是為因為什麼合理的裡由。

（這個系統）被創造為，如果要贏，你必須有很多的支持、媒體、等等的，並且和真切地為國家著想、真正的政治沒有關係。

### ==\*\* 10:12 - 10:20 **==

It's their game. It's a game of the traditional politician where they feel very safe, but it has nothing to do with real politics.
這是他們的遊戲。這是一個傳統政治人物會覺得很安全的遊戲，但是跟真正的「政治」沒有任何關係。

### 15:19 - 15:30

（在講籌組政黨參選的過程）
The first thing is that the structure is different. The way we have built the programs, the political programs of the party to win the election, has been done in a collaborative way.
第一個它的結構很不同。我們是透過協作的方式，來制定政黨運作的規範。

### ==\*\* 16:13 - 16:23 **==

So this is very important, also to change how you get here, not only to change what is inside, but also to change the system to get inside.
所以，改變「如何」達到目標也是很重要的。不是只有改變在（政治）系統裡面的（人），也要改變你「如何」進到系統裡面。

### 22:13 - 22:32

But the important thing is to put the definition of the politician just in the last phase, when the decision taken. Because usually when you put the politician have to write the law, and everything before. It's very easy, just by subtle, legal things, they can change the will of the decision.
重要的是，政治人物在最後一個階段才參與，在決定已經（由公民）產生後。因為當你讓政治人物立法，等等參與事前的工作時，他們很容易會透過「微小卻又合法」的方式，去改變原本決定的意旨。

### 29:13 - 29:35

Because it's trying to set all these new possible ways of participation, and the technology we have seen were success previously, together, to build a platform that is very powerful, and it really helps people to do things in an easy way.
這個系統試著把可能的新的參與方式、成功的科技整合起來，變成一個強大的平台，幫助人們能夠很容易地去做事。（政治實踐）

### ==\*\* 33:13 - 33:16 **==

And, we won, in all the major cities.
我們在所有主要的城市都取得了勝利。

### 34:00 - 34:31

And people seen from other cities that is very easy to use, that is possible, that breaks the barrier that always with "No, direct democracy is very complicated", "You know, internet, is impossible." all these kind of things.

當人們看到其他城市採行的新系統是好用的、是可能的，就可以打破以往的障礙，像是認為「不，直接民主太複雜了」、「你知道，網路，不可能的啦」等等的想法。

People see that "No, it's working!" And the decisions are great. And people are answering(?) very reachable things. And the money is well-spent. All these kind of things. People from other cities are gonna say, "okay, we want this. I don't care about if the people in power they don't want it. We want it. It's possible. Let's do it!"

人們看到「可以呀，這可行！」而且決策是好的、可行的，錢也有被善用。其他城市的人們就會說，「我們要這個。我不管有權力的政治人物不想要。我們想要這樣的系統（政治）、這是可行的、我們開始吧！」

### 34:57 - 35:13

And this why we think it's also important, of course it's important that all the tools we are building are free software, we are spreading the technologies, so anyone can just take it and use it. But it's also much more important, for the people to see it's happening, and it's not so difficult.
很重要的是，我們所創造的這些工具都是自由軟體，讓這些技術可以很容易的被傳播，任何人可以直接拿去使用；但更重要的是，讓人們看到「這正在發生」，而且（改變/新的政治）並不是那麼困難。

### 38:06 - 38:19

We have the hope we can go much beyond this, and really change how the things work, and to change how the country looks like. We'll see, in the next year or two years. What happens.

### ==\*\* 38:19 - 38:38 **==

Sherry: So you don't have any frustrations?
No, nooooooooooo. We are very sure it's gonna work. Because in every country, where they have this kind of mechanism, even in a traditional way. It works. It really works.

> （這段超有趣，哈哈哈哈）No, no, no, nooooo It always work!

### 39:03 - 39:06
