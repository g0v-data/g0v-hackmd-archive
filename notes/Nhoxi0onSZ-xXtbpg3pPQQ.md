# Term Paper of Electromagnetic Theory

## Introduction
  In contrast to natural materials, artificially structured electromagentic (EM) materials have the advantage of displaying novel EM responses. Consequently, this research area has become attractive and promising. Physicists, material scientists and engineers are dedicated to the study of new materials. Usually, these subwavelength composites are called metamaterials (MMs), which can be deliberately designed to have special resonant response the electrical permittivity (type formula) or magnetic permeability (type formula). In fact, the Drude-Lorentz model predicts the existence of negative ε1 or μ1. Although media with negative μ1 is less common in nature, artificial materials with negative μ1 were successfully realized with split-ring resonators (SRRs).
  The EM spectrum contains many sections. At microwave frequencies, knowledge of electronics is studied. At infrared frequencies, optics is learned. There is a region between these two bands, which is known to be terahertz (THz) regime. Devices in this band may have both electronic and photonic properties. The dimensions of structures can be scaled to present desired EM responses. It is good to have THz MMs since conventional microfabrication techniques support and novel MMs structures can be realized.
  People have designed and fabricated various categories of subwavelength resonators for MMs. And SRRs, which are mentioned before, are the most canonical ones. SRRs consists of metallic rings with gaps [1], which are appropriately designed combination of two sets of resonators. They produce negative ε1 and μ1 in the same frequency band and possess a negative refractive index. Furthermore, the MM structures are scalable to operate over most of EM spectrum spanning from microwaves to optical frequencies [2].
  When a time-varying magnetic field is polarized normal to the plane of the SRRs, circulating currents will be induced within the ring, resulting in an out-of-phase or negative magnetic response above the resonant frequency [3]. A potential impediment of SRRs to be used for the magnetic response at THz and higher frequencies is that the magnetic field needs to be perpendicular to the SRR plane for full magnetic field coupling. However, the EM waves are usually incident normal to the planar SRR structure with the magnetic field lying in the SRRs plane, which does not excite the magnetic resonance directly.
  Nonetheless, the first THz MM was experimentally demonstrated in 2004, showing a strong magnetic response around 1 THz, using a single planar layer of double SRRs array [4]. The MM sample was put in an ellipsometer measured in a transverse electric (TE) configuration at an angle of incidence of (type math) off-normal for the excitation of the magnetic response.
  The SRR can be though of as an LC resonator in a simple representation with a resonance frequency of (type formula), where the inductance results from the current path of the SRR and capacitance is mainly determined by the split gap and the dielectric properties of the substrate. With the polarization of electric field perpendicular to the SRR gap, two resonances are present, namely, an LC resonance (ω0) at lower frequency associated with circulating currents and a dipole resonance (ω1) at higher frequency.
  So far, the operation of ordinary MMs is confined with a narrow spectral range due to the nature of the resonator, which is a major limitation to most broadband applications. Efforts have been made on broadening the bandwidth of THz MMs by packing two or more resonators with different geometries into a single unit cell for multiresonant responses.
## THz MM Absorbers
  MMs can be regarded as an effective medium characterized by a complex electric permittivityε = ε1 + iε2 and complex magnetic permeability μ = μ1 + iμ2 .Considerable effort has focused on the real parts of permittivity(ε1 ) and permeability (μ1 ) to create a negative refractive material. 
  Tao et al. experimentally demonstrated a MM-based absorber with an absorptivity of 0.70 at 1.3 THz [5]. A single unit of the absorber consists of two distinct metallic elements: an electrical ring resonator and a magnetic resonator, as shown in Fig. 11.The electrical ring resonator consists of two single split rings sitting back to back, which couple strongly to the electric field,and negligibly to the magnetic field. The magnetic coupling is realized by combining the center wire of the electric resonator on the top layer with a cut wire on the bottom layer in a parallel plane separated by an 8-μm-thick polyimide spacer. 
  This study has been extended to a polarization insensitive design with a demonstrated absorptivity of 0.65 at 1.15 THz [6]. Tao et al. reported a resonant MM absorber fabricated on a metallic ground plane showing an absorptivity of 0.97 at 1.6 THz [7]. The absorber design is on a highly flexible polyimide substrate, which enables its use in nonplanar applications. In addition, the absorber can operate over a very wide range of incident angles for both TE and transverse magnetic(TM) configurations (see Fig. 12).
  Those MM absorbers may find numerous applications ranging from the active element in a thermal detector to THz stealth technology.
## THz MM Switches and Modulators
   Padilla et al. reported the first THz MM switch fabricated on GaAs substrates with the potential for creating dynamic MM resonance responses [8]. The electric resonance could be turn ON/OFF by photoexcitation of the free carriers in the GaAs substrate to short or open the resonator gap, which leads to a modulation on the THz radiation transmission.
   Another type of THz modulator via an external electric bias was reported by Chen et al. [9]. The SRR structures were fabricated on a thin n-type GaAs layer, where the conductivity can be externally modified by applying a voltage bias through a group of metallic wires connecting those resonators to a voltage
source.No resonance is observed, as the n-type GaAs substrate electrically shorts out the resonator gaps. The resonators serve as a Schottky contact with the substrate. A reverse voltage bias depletes carriers in the capacitive regions, thereby, isolating the metal from the doped substrate, resulting in the restoration of the resonance. A schematic of the device is shown in Fig. 14.This device could modulate the THz transmission by 50% at a few KHz. An improved version with a similar modulation mechanism but having a reduced RC time constant through judicious layout design enabled modulation at over 2 MHz [10]. 
   As these examples highlight, this new class of THz MM switches/modulators demonstrate a promising approach toward
promoting real-world applications such as THz communication and THz wave detections.
## THz MMs With Memory Effects
   Though most MMs are designed to operate at a single resonant frequency, decent progress has been made on developing frequency-agile MMs at THz frequencies that allow their resonant frequency to be tuned with certain stimulus, as mentioned earlier. However, the tuning is lost when the stimulus is taken away.
Driscoll et al. reported a new THz MM device that can remember the new frequency of operation by incorporating vanadium dioxide (VO2 ) into the conventional SRR structures [11].It is known that the metal-to-insulator phase transition of VO2 can be controlled with external optical or electrical stimulus and exhibiting hysteresis enables programming of the MMs response [12], [13]. The resonant frequency of the SRRs depends on the VO2 ’s capacitive properties and is set until the phase changes back. In their device, the resonant frequency was shifted from 1.65 THz by as much as 20% and persisted for at least 20 min, as shown in Fig. 18.

## Conclusion
   The utilization of and implementation of MMs at THz frequencies holds great promise for advancing applications in this technologically relevant region of the EM spectrum. THz EM MMs have drawn enormous attention and intensive research efforts, and a number of practical MM-based THz devices have been developed. Though most MM devices operate over a narrow spectral band due to their resonant nature, efforts have been put in making devices with frequency tunability and multiple/broadband functionality, which are favored for applications employing CW THz sources/detectors. There will be certain additional fundamental advances during the next decade coupled with the implementation of MMs into real-world THz applications.

<針對本課程的學習心得與建議>

經過一學期的課程使我對電磁理論有更廣泛深入的理解，同時也知道當前電磁相關領域的熱門研究主題。很快又到了期末，回想過去四個多月的上課內容，我覺得更深的了解到了「電磁學」這塊領域，但也深深地發現自己的不足，有時候會有跟不太上的情況，尤其是算式推導，這部分除了上課聽講外也得靠自己在更努力翻書跟請教老師同學了。經過一個學期的修習後，獲得更多的能力將電磁學的定性論述以數學方程式陳述出來，並且從中體會到前世的天才有多麼厲害且偉大，而透過老師課堂上的論述與思考引導，也學會了邏輯推演的步驟與必要的嚴謹度，真是收獲良多。
