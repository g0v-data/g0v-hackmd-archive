### What do you like most about Hackpad?

- neat, lean, low entry barrier for less tech-savvy people

### What do you like least about Hackpad? What could we do to make Hackpad a better user experience for Taiwanese users?

- I think the most annoying thing has been fixed in 2.0 - the Input Method issues i reported a while ago
- Collection is still a bit hard to organize things, that's why we built hackfoldr — see  [http://](http://hack.g0v.tw/)[hack.g0v.tw](http://hack.g0v.tw/)[/](http://hack.g0v.tw/)
- Chinese typography is not yet at the same level as the beautiful design of 2.0.
    - For Hei (sans-serif) typographic settings that goes well with **_Nova_**, please refer to "Han Heiti" here: [https://github.com/ethantw/Han/blob/master/sass/han/ff/_heiti.scss#L9](https://github.com/ethantw/Han/blob/master/sass/han/ff/_heiti.scss#L9)
        - CJK characters are a bit too wide with the current 17px setting; 15px would be optimal.
        - We're happy to offer more detailed CSS suggestions if you're interested.
- We also use Hackpad API to get content. (Like Communiques)
    - But it has some bug. when I use Markdown format to get content, it would be mojibake. ex. [https://gist.github.com/jessy1092/8630897](https://gist.github.com/jessy1092/8630897)from [https://note.hackpad.com/Test-RWK6WgnFBPZ](https://note.hackpad.com/Test-RWK6WgnFBPZ)
