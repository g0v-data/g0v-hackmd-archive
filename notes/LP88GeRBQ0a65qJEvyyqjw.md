《國土計畫法》在2015年底三讀通過。一直以來我們對它寄予厚望，但我們必須明瞭，《國土法》本身無法成為一切土地爭議的單一解答。

《國土法》乃框架式與價值指引的立法，其內涵正等待之後研擬的20項子法規來充實；「全國國土計畫」訂下全國土永續利用的管制策略與基本原則後，實質的空間計畫，以及現實中每筆土地所屬功能分區的指認，仍有待各地方政府擬訂的「直轄市、縣（市）國土計畫」與「國土功能分區圖」來落實。這是一套仍充滿變數的架構，中央與地方投入的努力以及執行效能，在在都影響著國土法後續的作用。
我們期待《國土法》引領台灣土地適地適性地發展，過程中公民力量不可或缺，因此地球公民基金會舉辦國土計畫工作坊，希望透過培力的課程串聯全台關心土地議題的夥伴，在未來互相交流支持，協力促成《國土法》的真正落實。

The "National Land Use Planning Act" was passed at the end of 2015 after the third reading.

While we have consistently invested great hopes in the Act, we must understand that the "National Land Act" itself can never be a sole solution for all land disputes.

The "National Land Use Act" offers a legislative framework and a value-based guideline. Its substance still awaits being fleshed out by 20 forthcoming sub-regulations. Once the "National Land Use Plan" has laid down the basic national control strategies and principles for sustainable land use, the actual space planning and actual identification of land allocated to each functional area will be developed and carried out by the local authorities under the "Municipal or County (City) Land Use Plan" and "National Land Use Area Map".

This is still a highly mutable structure. The efforts and operational effectiveness achieved by the central and local authorities will continue to affect the subsequent functions of the National Land Use Act.

While we look forward to the suitable and sustainable land development in Taiwan heralded by the "National Land Use Act", the power of the people during this process is indispensable.

For this reason, the Citizens of the Earth Foundation is planning to conduct national land use workshops in the hope that these training courses can bring together parties who are interested in land use issues and ensure that their mutual exchange and cooperation can promote the future implementation of the "National Land Use Act".

### Opening (Zheng-Zheng PAN)


Indeed, the devolution of the deliberative planning process to the local authorities is actually a neutral act; it can also be said to represent a shift in Taiwan towards a local awakening, providing an important opportunity for a new bottom-to-top politics. But, in reality, this ground-level deliberative force is bound to intensify the competition between local forces and different interest groups and subject the social authority of each municipality and county to serious tests.

Social and environmental movements must also advance to be able to confront the various land issues in the future. We must understand that the civic participation and channels promised by the "National Land Use Planning Act" are a necessary rather than secondary condition for implementing citizens' participation.

As to how a consensus can be reached, how disputes can be resolved, how the legitimacy of decisions can be strengthened, how people's knowledge of public affairs and trust in society can be enhanced, what is needed to realize these things is not only the government but also the self-growing force of the people. This is especially true at a time when so many different quarters have invested their hopes in the "National Land Use Planning Act".

The civic community must be even more active in its engagement: on a central level, it should monitor the strategic development of space planning and coordinate the platform capabilities of the various departments; on a local level, we should seek the disclosure of early national land use plans and public participation, and convey to the local authority the people's expectations about the national land use plans and the subsequent land use administration. It should become an actual political force and should pave a solid foundation for the future implementation of the National Land Use Planning Act.

Everyone should work together to understand the national/regional land use plans and any future land plans and disseminate information about the risks and benefits of these systematic changes.

### Summary (Ken-cheng LEE)


The key problem brought up by the southern group is on "translational interpretation". This situation is particularly important for us today. With all kinds of transmission channels on Facebook, whether or not your content can attract your audience or trigger them to do something is very crucial. This problem involves the different generations. The kind of people that young people like us can appeal to are other young people. For example, when Zhuo-Yue and Jun-Da are put in the spotlight, everyone pays attention. Another is the language being spoken. Those who have worked in the government or served as representatives have a better idea about how to communicate with the public and how to deal with people in the way they expect.

Second, everyone also brought up the cross-region sharing platform. It involves the "hackfoldr" that was just mentioned is used as a national platform or not. It has been used like this these past two days. Being able to include all counties and cities in this is a possibility. Having them all together allows us to observe and learn from other counties and cities. Also brought up was that some counties and cities or regions are already collecting information from emails from partners in this signup. Each region has a contact person who can directly provide the information. The problem we need to handle better is how to mutually add each other on Facebook. This is something that you can all work out on your own.

Third, a problem that we constantly face is that of properly using our energy. Ah-Bao asked what we can do if we don’t have any money or any resources. It is recommended that when everyone meets together, besides doing homework and giving mutual support, we should also take stock of people and resources. Let's see if this can be included.

Fourth, what Cheng-Yi brought up is important. Do not neglect the importance and necessity of making government work for us. You must make full use of these elected representatives. Some people might like being used. In some situations, you may have to convince them to do things. The maturity level of a group usually involves the ability to make the government work in its favor. This is something that needs to be learned over time. Making the government work for you is something good, not bad. It is not something that can just be ignored.

Fifth, there is a difference between some organizations in terms of full-time work. For example, some people participate in campaigns on a full-time basis, which runs into difficulties. The group takes on a whole lot of issues, and there is a difficulty in allocating the group's energy for dealing with long-term systemic problems. Some amateur teams have problems in terms of turnover. They actually all have their pros and cons. Actually, it is not a good thing for one team to have to deal with too many things at once. The key is to get more people to join in. For this matter to be successful, in addition to doing your own homework, there is also a pressing need for there to be more diversity in terms of the organizers because the situation will involve many different fields over the course of time. We must see if each city and county lets everyone continue to participate when setting up workshops and study clubs. This is the key when going forward. We are happy that many local organizations are thinking about how to meet together. This could be something that everyone can learn from.

In conclusion, from a certain perspective, the demand in the first stage is for making up the gap between the central government and the local governments. This entails information openness, public participation, and the level gap. Is there any way we can go to the local governments and convince them to go at a consistent pace? If everyone agrees to do this, then we can organize the issue of information openness into a clearly stated demand. This means that when the time comes, we have a well-defined issue to pressure the central government with. This will make it convenient to make bullet points for all documents on the existing channels of information. This is something we should be able to accomplish. It also involves our expectation of a discussion mechanism for the method of adding citizen representatives to the Executive Yuan's advisory committees. This involves a contest of strength with the government. The Citizens' Land Foundation can play some sort of role here. The partners can provide information at any time in the overall course of promoting the National Land Act and for the lobbying times and opportunities.

Last time, the regional planning workshop established a Facebook group called Information Platform for Monitoring Nationwide Regional Planning. It is recommended that everyone use this kind of phrasing for their own development cases: "It was not an easy thing to get this Land Act through legislation, so do we now have to do it all over again after the implementation rules for the National Land Planning Act are released?"

Just like with the Sea Coast Act, whenever we deal with coastal development, they always said to wait until after the Measures Governing Sea Coasts were released before building. After a few environmental deviation assessments, everything was put to a halt. It will not necessarily be useful in individual cases, but at least this will give us room to be able to make committee members take notice through different levels of review that a new law needs to come out. The lines have not been drawn yet, so do we have to wait for the higher-level policy to be released before a decision can be made? This is something you can try whenever there is a review.
