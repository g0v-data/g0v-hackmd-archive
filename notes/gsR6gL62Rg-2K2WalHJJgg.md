Been betting for about a year now and honestly I ignored bonuses at first because they seemed complicated. Recently started paying attention to [1xbet kenya promo code](https://1-xbet-ke.com/bonus) offers and realized some are actually useful if you read the terms carefully. The key is not getting excited about big bonus amounts and instead checking what you need to do to withdraw. I use promos mainly for trying new sports I don't usually bet on like tennis or rugby without risking my own money. If the bonus doesn't work out I haven't lost anything, but if it does I've learned something new. Just never change your betting strategy just to unlock a bonus because that's how you lose money fast
