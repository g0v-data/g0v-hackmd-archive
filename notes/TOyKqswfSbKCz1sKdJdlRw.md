# CSS revert-layer keyword Explained
Maintaining a consistent design across various browsers and devices is an ongoing challenge in web development. This challenge includes adapting styles for different device screens and dealing with overridden styles due to conflicting specificity or inheritance hierarchies.

When encountering overridden styles, a common approach is to use the `!important` property, which gives a style priority over others. However, as CSS continues to evolve, more advanced solutions are being introduced to tackle these challenges. CSS cascade layers are emerging as a promising solution, providing a more refined approach to manage and resolve styles.

In this article, we will discuss CSS cascade layers, focusing on the `revert-layer` keyword. We will explain how cascade layers function, when to utilize them, the purpose of the `revert-layer` keyword, and its various use cases.
## Exploring CSS Cascade Layers
The at-rule introduced by cascade layers, belonging to `@layer`, is particularly useful when dealing with multiple CSS sources. It allows authors to define and order their CSS rules or layering schemes, thereby avoiding specificity conflicts.

Cascade layers are especially beneficial when you are considering using the `!important` property in your CSS styles. They are highly relevant in such situations. Another scenario where cascade layers should be used is when there are conflicting CSS selectors and specificity.
