milestones?
2. Process and Tools:
○ Could you explain the process by which citizens participate in vTaiwan's
discussions and policymaking? How are they selected ? Does the “ordinary
citizen” participates in these type of discussions, or are there always people
with some kind of expertise/experience/strong interest in policy?
○ How does vTaiwan ensure that the platforms are accessible and inclusive for
all citizens? Ex; Rural communities, older people

specific instances where public input through vTaiwan led to meaningful
changes?

these been addressed? Are there limitations that have yet to be addressed?

with digital democracy and open government?

expansion or new initiatives? In case yes, are there any political or practical
issues that are hindering its evolution?

countries or regions adopted similar approaches?
