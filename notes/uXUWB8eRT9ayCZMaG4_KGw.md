Automobiles do prefer liquids, not for hydration but mostly for lubrication. Apart from fuel or coolant, there is always a need for lubrication in every nook and corner. Brakes also need essential fluids. 

It majorly transfers the pressure and helps in slowing down the vehicle that a pedal generates when a driver presses it. However, brake fluid is critical for a car, and it is impossible to stop a car if brake fluids go down.

The scarcity of brake fluid may be dangerous, especially when your car is in driving mode. However, it would be hard to imagine a vehicle without brakes, or more specifically, fluid.

Though vehicles cannot converse, they still possess the capacity to tell about the problems. Look at these intimations that tell you about problems with brake fluids.

**1. A brake light warning illuminates on your car’s dashboard**

Warning lights on a car’s dashboard send strong signals to existing problems. Though a brake light might illuminate for any reason, not necessarily for the emergency of brake fluid, but if it comes on, just consult with a professional.

**2. The pedal does not work properly**

Usually, when brake fluid is low, a car’s brake pedal does not work properly, and it goes down too easily when you just put your foot on it. However, it happens due to contaminated fluid and a lack of air in the brake unit.

**3. Spots of fluid near wheels**

Brake fluid leaks usually create spots around the wheels. If you find these spots consistently, never delay visiting the nearest Service My Car workshop.

Brake fluid does not require frequent replacement unless it goes low in quantity and quality.  But, how do you conclude that your vehicle’s brake fluid is going to be low? However, if you find oil spots under your car regularly, dig deep for a better conclusion.

Most frequently, brake fluid is clear to brown in colour and slightly yellow. Additionally, it has a smooth viscosity. You will probably find a puddle that fits this description close to one of your car's wheels if you have a brake fluid leak.

Keeping the importance of brakes in mind, there is no point in putting yourself at risk.

Unlike other automobile fluids, the brake fluid shows a tendency to absorb water. It is also limited in quantity. Besides, leakage is always behind low brake fluid quantities. Leakage often happens due to damaged parts, specifically the worn reservoir.
However, brake fluid must be replaced every two years due to contamination and loss of efficacy during braking.

Besides, the worn brake pads are known to be a major reason behind the low brake fluid. Worn pads may require more from the brake fluids, and their capacity may be reduced due to extensive usage.

However, identifying worn brake pads is simple because there is insufficient pressure after pressing the pedal. Therefore, opting for the brake pad replacement is the better choice, and Service My Car is definitely going to help you make yourself more secure, And you can also search for a car [head gasket replace cost](https://servicemycar.com/uk/services/car-head-gasket-repair-manchester) on the web, to opt for car repair and head gasket replacement in Manchester at a very reasonable price.

Low brake fluid might end up resulting in a failure. However, it does not occur to you that you are experiencing any troubling symptoms. Failed brakes are something a driver would not prefer in their dreams either. Though you can control a vehicle in such an extreme condition, it is better to prevent such a problem.

In case of brake failure, you should take care of your and others' safety. You should inform other vehicles about the brake failure by pressing the brake to highlight the rear lights. On the other hand, you can use the hazard lights.

Gradually apply the parking brakes while lowering the RPMs by shifting transmission. Once your vehicle slows down enough, try to move it off the road and run into some rough terrain or grass. Also, turn off the engine so that external friction can assist the tyres in slowing down and eventually stopping.

## Is it possible to add brake fluid on your own?
