# What is ‘Pagoda’?

## Strengthening and Uniting Asian Communities Towards Devcon SEA 2024 & Beyond

To ensure the success of Devcon in the Asian region, it is vital to establish a robust coordination hub for Asian builders and ecosystem leaders. Our aim is to unite community leaders from across Asia for Devcon, so we show up to Devcon owning our unique approaches, philosophies, and values towards building a decentralized world. Devon is a powerful catalyst for bringing our ecosystems closer to each other, to build  stronger connections and trust among ourselves, and bridge us with global Ethereum ecosystems.  Pagoda aims to leverage the Devcon momentum to forge a deeper alliance within Asia, and serve as a conduit for better integration with the global community.

Bringing more diverse voices and approaches to the crypto world is more crucial than ever. Asia has a significant role to play in decentralized governance, community initiatives, environmental advocacy, and culture. The Pagoda Gathering intends to be a focal coordination point for dedicated ecosystem builders in Asia, providing a safe and open platform for dialogue, coordination, and alignment in the development of stronger Ethereum ecosystems.

A major outcome from Pagoda is to solidify Asia's position in the global Ethereum community, by owning our own narratives, highlighting the region's unique contributions, and fostering collaboration across diverse cultures and disciplines.

## Gathering Components:

- Online Activation: the whole month of March via Zoom
    - Objective: To facilitate initial discussions to co-create our time together in person, and, establishing early connections among participants. This lays the groundwork for stronger ties among Asian ecosystem builders, and creates a better understanding so we take full advantage of our time together. (3-4 calls)

### **(Part 1) Think Pod: 3rd-6th April at 4SEAS**

- Purpose: To provide a strategic platform for Asian leaders to delve into nuanced cultural insights, challenges and operational realities in our respective ecosystems, and laying out what decentralization means in our respective worlds. We look into the past, present, and future.
- Participants: 1-3 leaders from each North/South East Asian countries, totaling 20-25 targeted individuals.
- Key Activities: Engaging in meaningful dialogue to identify challenges and opportunities, co-developing a vision for Ethereum's future in Asia, and crafting collective narratives that draw from Asian philosophies and histories.

### **(Part 2) Convergence: 8-11th April at 4SEAS**

- Purpose: To drive more community involvement in shaping our collective approach to growing our communities, crafting shared narratives, and laying out our direction as an ecosystem.This is a more inclusive space with broader communities and builders from across Asia joining to build stronger connections.
- Participants: Additional 1-3 representatives from each North/South East Asian country (including Think Pod attendees), totaling 50 people who play a pivotal role in their local ecosystems.
- Key Activities: Mapping the ecosystem's key players, events, and resources, and strategizing practical activation plans.

These sessions will then be followed by online  dialogues, collaborative mapping activities, and gatherings that continue the threads we start at Pagoda, and involve more communities.

## After Pagoda :

Pagoda's future results will be overseen by its community, with ABCD (Asia Based Community Dorgs) serving as the primary hub for further assistance and collaborative efforts among developers. The period from April to November is anticipated to be crucial for support in the region, including event organization, onboarding, narrative development, and global community support.

We plan to organize another event after Devcon to continue and strengthen Asia's collaborative ethos. Despite potential unknown challenges, our commitment remains unwavering in nurturing and advancing these concepts and projects.
