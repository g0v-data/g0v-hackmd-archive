Hi Krzysztof,

This is chihao, one of the co-founders of “g0v international”, abbreviated as g0v-intl. g0v-intl is a g0v task force that aims to facilitate international exchanges of g0v as the community see fit. We moderate and coordinate international-oriented g0v projects in the same values g0v is founded on: open by default, transparency, and civic responsibility.

We g0v-intl would love to be on the ExCo of Code for All for this 9-month rotation. Isabel Hou (isabel), pm5, and myself are the three co-founders of the task force, and we will take turns in joining the ExCo meetings. For listing and communication purposes, we would like the following title & email to be used instead of any of our individual contact:

g0v international task force
g0v-intl@googlegroups.com

Since g0v-intl’s main purpose is to coordinate and connect, we should not be seen as representatives of, but a bridge to the g0v community. All decisions will be brought back to the community for further discussion and resolutions will be rendered accordingly. By doing so, we expect more g0vers to get involved and participate in the Code for All network and international exchanges in general.

Thank you and looking forward to your feedback.

chihao
