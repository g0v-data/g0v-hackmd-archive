某次的活動分享，英文翻譯~

Hello everyone, my name is chewei.

I'd like to propose a project "Patch by Planting" today.

The goal of this project is to find the incremental number or area of greenfields.

There is an international research project regarding fields without vegetation on a global scale.

This research is to search for the opportunity of reducing carbon dioxide by vegetating lands without forests.

We can implement some simple measures from related research on the length scale of Taiwan.

In order to calculate the number of trees, firstly we need to figure out where trees are.

Following that, we proceed to finding potential sites, then evaluate and vegetate these places.

For the map of trees, we are using satellite maps since the coverage of its data include the territory of Taiwan.

From the map covering the entire territory, furthermore, we can infer how many trees can be planted in these potential sites, which is estimated to be totally 2.7 million.

But there are some assumptions here, so that we are inviting folks interested in joining the discussion together.

We have uploaded the locations of these potential sites to the online map, please refer to it.

Among these sites, there are some representative places, such as two parking lots in front of the Office of the President.

These are squares in Urban Plans, so to speak, and there are 72 street trees around them.

Compared to other nearby street trees, these trees here are shorter and smaller, and sort of flattop.

So why is that?

First of all, we check the street tree documents of Taipei City, and realize there should be 72 trees indeed, but the documents do not explain why these are flat-top.

So we speculate whether it is due to historical reasons, as the place is very close to the Office of the President and etc.

We then realise that on the Academia Sinica website of historical maps, in 1945 USAF aerial photos, these squares did not exist, instead, there were buildings and houses.

However, in the photos of Jun 17th, 1945, these buildings and houses disappeared, besides, the Office of the President was damaged.

The reason is that, during the Taihoku Air Raid, these two squares were bombarded and later reserved as open places.

and mostly remained as parking lots after WorldWarII.

Today, we would like to shout out to folks to join the discussion digging into the mystery of these 72 street trees.

which reflect that, when we find out the potential sites, what features and stories they have, and why they are not vegatated. They may have their own

In addition, as we mentioned, the resolution of street trees isn't great in the satellite maps, so we would like to refer to the study from the website Treepedia, released by MIT.

It is calculating the green canopy based on Google Street View.

Perhaps, this method may help us to figure out sites that can be vegetated in Taiwan.

Overall, we would like to establish the process via three key methods. Meanwhile, we are also participating in the Presidential Hackathon.

In the future, we will investigate these potential sites through checking the satellite maps and make a list.

Throughout the list, the vegetation can be done in either the governmental or non-governmental means.

Alternatively, the government can propose ideas that will be subjected to participatory discussion.

We also invited two architect friends from French. They have built an online tool that enables people to join the design, like the example here.

In other words, people can propose to add facilities or trees by illustrating their visions online.

With that, we would like to invite folks who are interested in collaborating on these ideas in the hackathon.

Thank you.
