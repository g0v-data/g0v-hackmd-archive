This report is based on interviews with four participants—Blue, Green, Pink, and Yellow—analyzing Gen Z’s motivations for participating in the g0v community. Their narratives provide unique insights into their personal journeys and modes of participation.

## Research Motivation  

As a decentralized, open collaboration platform, g0v attracts participants from diverse backgrounds, uniting them around projects to use technology and creativity in addressing social issues. However, as g0v evolves, so do its participation dynamics and member composition. While prior studies have examined g0v’s operations, project outcomes, and social impact, little attention has been given to the internal motivations and challenges faced by members who continue to engage with g0v over the long term.  

I am curious about what compels participants to remain in such a highly decentralized and fluid community. Are they driven by specific values or experiences? Additionally, what challenges do they face under g0v’s open, unstructured framework—such as resource scarcity, collaboration difficulties, or the stress of community decline? These questions are not only relevant on an individual level but also crucial for understanding g0v’s sustainability and future development.  

Some participants have observed significant generational differences between younger Gen Z participants and early members shaped by the Sunflower Movement. For instance, the motivations of Gen Z participants seem less politically driven and more focused on tangible project outcomes and real-world impact. This generational divergence raises intriguing questions: What attracts these young people to g0v? How do they perceive g0v’s values and significance? Do their contributions reflect new perspectives on public issues, technological applications, or community collaboration?  

By focusing on the core Gen Z participants, I aim to uncover their motivations, challenges, and the fresh energy and perspectives they bring to g0v. I also hope this research can offer insights to other open communities on how to better support the participation of younger generations and foster continuous innovation and growth.
