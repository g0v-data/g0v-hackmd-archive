Cofacts LINE Bot User Manual
====
Cofacts is a **crowdsourcing** and **open-source** non-profit project. We encourage volunteers to work together and we release our **source code, information, and data** to the public.

## What a user can contribute:

### Provide a suspicious message.
By using Cofacts LINE bot, you can also be a collaborator of the project!

The message you forwarded and sent to our database. Then we provide you with a list of the requests you’ve made in the past.


### Be a hoax-buster.
Do you think the existing responses are not good enough?

1. Log in to Cofacts database. Be a hoax-buster yourself.
2. One single request can have multiple responses. Get in there and post the response of your investigation and take a step closer to unravelling its truth to help others.
3. Its too slow to wait for others to respond. Investigate your own request and post a response!

The mechanics behind the Cofacts LINE bot’s responses.

1. You do not get a response if the database has no similar record as your request.
2. An editor logs into the database and sees your pending request.
3. The editor investigates on their own and leaves a response to your request in the database.
4. Other users receive similar hoax messages then forward to our LINE bot.
5. Then the LINE bot will find your request post as a possible match and provide that user with information of the hoax and verification responses of the hoax-busting.
:::

The message you send will be seen by other users as a possible hoax or scam.

Being the first one to post the first pending request, you won’t be able to find a match nor can you see any hoax bust result. However, you will be a pioneer of busting that hoax and any other similar hoaxes.

We thank you for your contribution for making our database better and making our world a better place with less hoaxes and scams.


Therefore,
- We do not suggest that you chit-chat with the bot and send the message to Cofacts database for others to see.
- Since others might see it, we do not tolerate the action of exposing other people’s personal information, such as names or phone numbers, then send it to our database. 
- Since others might see it, we do not encourage you send things you will only share with your friends to our database.

However,
- We encourage you to send any suspicious or questionable messages to our database because others may find them useful.
- We encourage you to send any fake news or over-exaggerated messages to our database because others may find them useful.
