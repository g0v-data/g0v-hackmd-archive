I just finished a small form factor build last week and finding the right PSU was harder than I thought. A lot of standard units are too big for compact cases and cable management gets really tight. I came across this article https://seasonic.com/insights/seasonic-ander-seaview-case-focus-spx-750/ that talks about pairing PSUs with smaller cases and it actually helped me figure out what size I needed. The main thing is making sure your PSU fits the case dimensions and has enough power for your parts. My build turned out clean and everything fits without forcing cables into weird spots. Temperature stays low too because the airflow isn't blocked
