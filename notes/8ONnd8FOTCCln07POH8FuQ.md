You can find lots of details guides and reports about disasters. But it's not easy to find public available IT systems to know the status of disasters. Japan government is planing to have Disaster Prevention Agency( 防災庁 ) in 2026, and hope they can build the standards to interchange information between different local governments.

Taiwan has a special law ([災害防救法](https://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=D0120014)) to build a task force during the disaster happening, called Disaster Response Center(災害應變中心). This task force has higher level than other existing administrative units and it had integrated lots of information from different sources. Recently they even release the realtime disaster issue reports as open data and I(kiang) build a map to show them on the map ( https://tainan.olc.tw/p/emic/ ).
