### Getting Started 
To integrate Google Speech-to-Text API into a web application using JavaScript, you need to follow these steps: 

#### Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Platform
To setup the speech to text we need to get google API key first, for that we've to go <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Console.</a>

2. Create the server script 
3. Save the service account JSON file to your project directory, e.g., service-account-file.json.

3. Run the server 

`node server.js` 

### Step 3: Create the Front-End

1. Create an HTML file

You can use a simple server like http-server to serve the HTML file, or integrate it into your existing server setup.

**Run the server to check**, Open your browser and navigate to your front-end HTML file (you might need a local server to serve your HTML file, such as using http-server).


### Step 4: Testing

-    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
 -   Click "Start Recording" and speak into your microphone.
  -  Click "Stop Recording" and wait for the transcription to appear.

#### Important Notes

- Service Account Key: The keyFilename in the SpeechClient configuration should point to the service account JSON file. This is where your credentials are stored.

- Secure Your Backend: Ensure your backend is secure and only accessible to authorized clients to prevent misuse.
- Ensure CORS is properly configured if you're making cross-origin requests.
- This example uses recorder.js for capturing audio. You can use other libraries if needed.
- Make sure to secure your backend API to prevent unauthorized access.
