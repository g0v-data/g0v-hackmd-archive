### Goal

- Discuss how the existing community can leverage web3 tools

- Features
    - Decentralized ID â†’ decentralized society
    - Impact Certificate
    - Soulbound token
- Tooling
    - general principle: the simpler the better
    - KaliDAO
    - Need soulbound tokens
        - HyperSearch from Gitcoin/protocol labs
            - can we fork to make it non-transferrable
    - Internal tooling?
- Decision making
    - g0v currently does not do much voting other than small things like logistics / operations (eg. slippers)
    - proof of time/work - communication until consensus
    - more contribution, more voice? (e.g OrangeDAO, BZD)
    - Decision making levels
        - DAO - shared treasury / brand
        - Project based - proof of work (people who are working on it decides
        - Small decisions - make your own decisions or engage people (what type of slippers)
- Organization
    - Currently all projects are loosely organized on google spreadsheets
    - Is there a better way or need to do this?
    - There is someone helping with facilitating resources, usually no conflict of interest due to resource constraint.
    - Can each project be a subDAO? or its own DAO? Will be a long process to get there if we want to go that direction
- Contribution measurement
    - Pre-fix token budgeting (hard to pre-determine and negotiate)
    - time based (more simple / fair / easy)
    - bounty based by project metrics (better incentive alignment)
        - attendance of event
        - help write x paper
- Other people involvement
    - Stamford: KaliDAO
    - Jacky: BZD
        - Mission driven alignment to help Taiwan
        - Knowledge/resources sharing, and love building DAOs
