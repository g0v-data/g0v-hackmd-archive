We, as individuals concerned with human rights protection in Asia, hereby resolve to establish an independent court of the peoples, by the peoples and for the peoples of Asia, to promote human rights protection and deliver judgements to Asian governments, and proclaim the foundation of the Asian Human Rights Court Simulation on 7 October 2018.
吾等關心亞洲人權保護之個人，在此決定成立民有、民治、民享之獨立法院，以促進人權保護、向亞洲政府提供判決，並於2018年10月7日宣布創辦模擬亞洲人權法院。

For the purposes of this Statute, unless the context otherwise requires:

件。（七名？二十一名？）法官之選任應由在人權領域卓有貢獻之專家提名，並由法院發起人同意任命。
> 從概念上看起來應是21名。不然21名法官當中只有7名由人權專家提名，其他人選應該怎麼產生就沒交代了。[name=howie]
