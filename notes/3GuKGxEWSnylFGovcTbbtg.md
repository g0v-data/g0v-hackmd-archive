經濟部宣布全國能源會議26日、27日登場，為順應網路趨勢，經濟部擬於14～20日先舉辦網路會議，師法去年經貿國是會議及青年居住論壇採「網路互動」模式，選用Loomio網路社群討論平台，虛實整合廣蒐各界意見，再提至大會做為參考。

Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MoEA) announced the National Energy Conference is going to take place in Jan 26, 27. To follow the trends of collecting voices on the internet in nowadays, MoEA planned pre-conference discussions on the internet during the week of Jan 14-20.

They chose Loomio as the platform, using the interactive mode like both National Conference on Economic and Trade Affairs and  the  Youth  Housing Forum, in order to collect more comments from internet as reference materials of the main assembly at the National Energy Conference.

為凝聚議題共識，經濟部之前在全台先行舉辦8場分區會議、3場分團體會議，能源局長王運銘指出，分區會議中，各界爭論最多還是在核能問題，包括核四存廢及三座核電廠的延役、核廢料與成本問題等；另外包括產業結構調整、電價問題、電業自由化、溫室氣體減量法立法、能源稅條例等，也都在過去幾場分區座談受到熱烈討論。

To gather consensus around the issues, the MoEA initiated 8 regional deliberations and 3 interest-group deliberations. Wang Yun-Ming, the director of the Bureau of Energy, reported that the nuclear issues remained the main contention point during the regional deliberations, including:
- The fate of the currently mothballed Nuclear Plant #4
- The continued operation of the three existing Nuclear Plants
- Nuclear waste disposal options and associated costs

Other deliberation subjects with considerable interests were:
- The restructuring of Taiwan's industries
- Fair pricing of electricity
- Liberalization of electric power production
- Legislative efforts toward greenhouse gas reduction
- Executive efforts toward an energy tax

王運銘指出，在全國能源會議舉辦前，預計14日至20日將先舉行為期一周的網路會議，主辦單位將在Loomio討論區拋出議題，由網友選擇參與討論，相關人員當日彙整、歸納各方意見，隔日再進行下個議程。
Wang remarked that, before National Energy Conference, there will be a week during January 14-20 for deliberation on Loomio's forums. The host will set topics for discussion, where participants can freely bring forth their contributions. Moderators will summarize on a day-by-day basis, setting the topics of the next day based on each day's discussions.

據悉，經濟部籌辦全國能源會議時，政院高層屢次認為「傾聽網路聲音的比例不夠」，甚至要拿教育部舉辦青年居住論壇的網路對話平台為例，批評經濟部主辦的能源會議稍嫌呆板，雖已添加開放式網路平台討論，但不夠活潑，更缺少「封閉式平台」進行深度討論，要求經濟部得向教育部「多多學習」。
It is reported that when the MoEA hosted National Energy Conference, top-level Executive officials expressed concerns over the "insufficient amount of listening on the Internet," compared to Ministry of Education (MoE)'s work on the Youth  Housing Forum.

Their main concern is that MoEA's existing web presence and forums, while open to participation, is somewhat rigid and not sufficiently engaging. The other concern is the omission of special-interest-group style deliberations for in-depth, multi-round discussions, and the officials said MoEA has "a lot to learn" from MoE.

不過，能源議題本就較為專業與生硬，除特殊學術背景的人士或社會團體之外，一般民眾根本就「霧沙沙」。官員就抱怨，很多時候大家根本還沒有聽到政策，就先被網路謠言給洗腦，未來各行政機關勢必得再加強網路平台溝通，否則民眾難以了解真實的能源政策，更甭說要加入討論了。

However, the subject of energy policies requires understanding of more professional, hard-science background materials. With the exceptions of specialists and activist groups, the common citizens are prone to get "confused."

Government officials lamented that people are often brainwashed by internet rumors even before the actual policies are communicated. They indicated that it's the duty of all Executive functions to enhance their communication efforts on internet platforms, as participants uninformed of policy content is unlikely to deliberate well.

去年經貿國是會議時，Loomio也扮演重要角色，開放各界針對經貿國是會議內容討論，為國內首創；但能源會議討論題目更為專業，能否在網路世界凝聚共識，仍有待挑戰。

Loomio has also played an important part during 2014's National Conference on Economic and Trade Affairs, where people in all areas of life deliberated on the conference's contents online. As the succession of that inaugural attempt, the main challenge remains if the higher professional requirements of National Energy Conference's topics would make it more difficult for the online world to deliberate and reach consensus.
