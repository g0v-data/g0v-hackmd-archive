# CSS revert-layer keyword Explained
Maintaining a consistent design across various browsers and devices is an ongoing challenge in web development. This challenge includes adapting styles for different device screens and dealing with overridden styles due to conflicting specificity or inheritance hierarchies.

When encountering overridden styles, a common approach is to use the `!important` property, which gives a style priority over others. However, as CSS continues to evolve, more advanced solutions are being introduced to tackle these challenges. CSS cascade layers are emerging as a promising solution, providing a more refined approach to manage and resolve styles.

In this article, we will discuss CSS cascade layers, focusing on the `revert-layer` keyword. We will explain how cascade layers function, when to utilize them, the purpose of the `revert-layer` keyword, and its various use cases.
## Exploring CSS Cascade Layers
The at-rule introduced by cascade layers, belonging to `@layer`, is particularly useful when dealing with multiple CSS sources. It allows authors to define and order their CSS rules or layering schemes, thereby avoiding specificity conflicts.

Cascade layers are especially beneficial when you are considering using the `!important` property in your CSS styles. They are highly relevant in such situations. Another scenario where cascade layers should be used is when there are conflicting CSS selectors and specificity.

We will discuss additional use cases for cascade layers later. In the meantime, let’s examine an example. In the following code, we have two cascade layers accompanied by HTML markup:
```html
<body>
    <ul>
        <li class="item feature">Item one</li>
        <li class="item">Item two</li>
        <li class="item">Item three</li>
    </ul>
</body>
```
The code above defines an unordered list `<ul>` with three list items `<li>`, each having the class `item`. The first list item also has the class `feature`, displaying three items in a list format.
```css
@layer base, special;
@layer special {
    .feature {
        font-weight: bold;
    }
}

@layer base {
    .item {
        color: blue;
    }
}
```
This code organizes CSS styles into two layers, with the "base" layer setting the text color of elements with the class `.item` to blue, and the "special" layer setting the font weight of elements with the class `.feature` to bold.

Similarly, we have arranged the layers in such a way that priority is given to the special layer over the base layer, resulting in the image shown below:

We can utilize multiple CSS sources or layers, allowing us to prioritize and override specific styles without relying on selector specificity or the `!important` property. 

In this article, our focus is on understanding the cascade layer keyword known as `revert-layer` and exploring its various use cases. Without further ado, let’s delve into the `revert-layer` CSS keyword
## Understanding CSS revert-layer
The `revert-layer` keyword in CSS allows a property to revert to the value of the same property in a previous layer of the cascade. If there is no previous value set, it reverts to the default browser styles. This keyword can be applied to any CSS property, including the shorthand property `all`. Here's an example:
```html
<body>
    <h1>Test Subject</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="item feature">Subject one</li>
        <li class="item">Subject two</li>
        <li class="item">Subject three</li>
    </ul>
</body>
```
In the code above, we have a heading element and a list of items. Now, let’s write our CSS:
```css
@layer base, special;
@layer special {
    .item {
        color: red;
    }
}

@layer base {
    .item {
        color: blue;
        font-weight: normal;
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    .feature {
        color: green;
    }
}
```
The code above defines two layers (`base` and `special`), where `special` sets `.item` color to red, and `base` sets `.item` color to blue, font weight to normal, font size to 16px, and `.feature` color to green, with `base` taking precedence over `special`.

In our previous example, we have two layers. As we explained earlier, all items will appear in red because the `color` property inside the `special` layer scheme takes the highest priority.

If we reorder our layers to `@layer special, base;` just as written below:
```css
@layer special, base;
@layer base {
    .item {
        color: blue;
        font-weight: normal;
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    .feature {
        color: green;
    }
}
@layer special {
    .item {
        color: red;
    }
}
```
As a result of the change made in the code all items will become blue, excluding the first item, which will be green.
