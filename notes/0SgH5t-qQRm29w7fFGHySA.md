I've been collecting Rust skins for about two years now and honestly the best approach is to focus on popular weapon skins first - AK, M4, Bolt Action. Those hold value better than random clothing items. For finding good deals I usually check multiple platforms but https://dmarket.com/ingame-items/item-list/rust-skins has worked well for me lately. Their prices seem fair and the selection is pretty decent. Just make sure you're not overpaying for skins that might drop in price when new cases come out. Also avoid really worn condition items unless you're on a tight budget
