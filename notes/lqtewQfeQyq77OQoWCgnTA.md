## Intro



## Agenda

### Buffer Time & Introduction (12:30–13:00)

### Preliminary report on case studies (13:00–13:30)

We will be sharing lessons learned from previous interviews: 

- Open Parliament initiatives
- vTaiwan
- jothon
- Cofacts
- Code for Japan
- Code for Korea

### Workshop (13:30–14:00)

We’ll invite participants to share their experiences from their own projects—what are the lessons they’ve learned throughout the process? What was their experience on public/private partnerships, and how do they see their projects contribute on democractic resilience?

Finally, we will invite participants to think about the factors that would contribute to the community’s sustainability, giving out their own policy recommendations.

*Attendees may share their ideas during and after the workshop with sticky notes.
