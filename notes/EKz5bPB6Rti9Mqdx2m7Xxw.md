**Questions to Audrey for Film**


* ★ What were the scariest moments, where you were most concerned something was going to go awry or fail?

The most worrisome time for me was during the Sunflower Movement in 2014, when I saw several demonstrators attempt to take the Executive Yuan via the g0v live broadcast on the night of March 22.

According to the history of previous revolutions in many nations, once violence breaks out, the conflict would intensify. Simultaneously, g0v's citizen hackers have begun to develop a collaborative method for occupying the scene, such as “passersby hackathon,” which implies that anybody passing by or around the scene can join the debate of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement and the Sunflower movement itself at any moment. So my concern at the time was that if an attack state occurred, the coordination mechanism would collapse, making substantial conversations on the topic of trade in services impossible.

* ★ What is an example of one of the most difficult decisions you have made in the course of your efforts to improv Taiwanese democracy? What were the options in front of you? What was the case for each option? What made the decision difficult? Do you ever wonder whether things might have turned out better if you had gone the other direction?

The most challenging decision for me was in August-September 2016, when I was contemplating how to define my job scope after joining the cabinet team.

There are numerous possibilities. One is to aid in the adjustment of all digital-related civil service systems so that they can keep up with the times; or, conversely, to let the outside world know the condition of the civil service system and allow the language within to be translated into what the outside world knows. But I picked a method that no one had considered: “public servants of public servants,” which means to aid the civil service thoroughly  so that everyone may save work and feel at peace.

Why is this such a difficult decision? Because this approach is all about “not-doing” (wu-wei). When social expectations are high, everyone will support you in whatever you want to do, but not commanding anything will make everyone's expectations fall short, and they don't know how to help. Because there are really very few people who actually provide assistance, such as writing implementation points, but for others, the barrier to providing support will be high.

It's difficult to say if a different strategy would have been better or worse. Given the inability to debate importing Japanese food products from areas affected by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, labor basis legislation (one case and one break)/annuity reform, and the violent conflict of same sex marriage legalization during 2016-2018 in Taiwan, I believe it is unsuitable and incapable for me to apply the top-down strategy in political practice.


* ★ What is unique about the situation in Taiwan that others inspired by your work should take note of if they try to implement similar things in different contexts? (eg, maybe the age of government, amount of legacy "code" / legislation or something about Taiwanese cultural values). 

Taiwan is really interesting because we’re a very young democracy. We only got democracy 30 years ago. 30 years ago, there was lifting of the martial law.

My generation is the first generation to enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of assembly. My parents’ generation, they can’t really do this. When they were university students there was still martial law going on. We’re really new to this democracy thing.

Interestingly, they were the first generation to direct election of the president of Taiwan, and also the first generation to do interconnectivity, to do ICT-based development because the World Wide Woeb came in ’96. It was also the year where we had our first presidential election.

Instead of in many older democracies where there are people working on the dominance and people working on innovation, and they don’t really consider them as the same tribe, here in Taiwan I’ve seen a bunch of people doing democratic innovations and ICT innovations. I think that’s kind of special here in Taiwan.

* Does anything strike you as particularly different in the American context -- where you would specifically take a very different approach to something if you were trying to achieve similar goals here?

Personally, my attitude in any scenario is to “take all the sides,” so there is no “different approach” at all. In my perspective, “taking all sides” may be the same in the United States or somewhere else in the world. It must be a topic that no one opposes to when it is implemented. One example is PDIS‘s redesign of Taiwan's tax filing software's user interface. However, the extent to which this method may be applied in the United States will not be understood until it is implemented.

* What were the most bitter moments of defeat? (Or if not bitter, the moments of defeat, lol)

I've had no bitter moments (of defeat) since joining the cabinet because I “take all the sides”; I just promote “reaching consensus quicker” and “pushing innovation faster,” but only to the degree that they match everyone's expectations, not the other way around. There is no such thing as failure, whether a certain goal is met or not.

* Occupy Taiwan Parliament seems to have been much more successful at achieving change than say Occupy Wall St -- if you were on the ground at the latter, is there anything specific you would have pushed for that might have led to a different outcome?

I think the insistence of making a maximally inclusive space is very important. In Occupy, elsewhere as well as in Taiwan, the decision-making is always about having an open-space technology point of view, like whomever showing up is the right people

People who show up should give the autonomy of expressing their opinions, arrive at a collective decision, and so on. All this is very different from a traditional representative politics, where people of an association, a trade, or whatever are assumed to be homogeneous. They just send one representative to speak on behalf of their interest.

Occupy is all about everybody who show up, just speak for themselves. We make sure that, using information technology, we re-present their positions, rather than we as communicators represent their positions.

This shift from representativeness to re-presentation of people’s genuine, authentic opinion, I think that is very important, and that directly led to the e-participation process, including petition and participatory budgeting.

Taiwan's Sunflower movement is quite unique in that, because it takes place directly in the legislative chambers. The demonstration is even stronger than many other Occupy movement, because it’s literally people taking the issues to their own hands. The Sunflower Occupy, the core people, the NGOs and the civic tech people, they reinforce each other’s legitimacy. Literally, like the legitimacy theory was the MPs were on strike, so people had to do their work themselves.

With live streaming, it could be like the co-presencing. People were calling for the same co-presencing with the administration. The administration wasn’t ready for that.

That was the Sunflower Movement’s goal, is to demonstrate that even with half a million people in the street and many more online, we can still come to rough consensus with regard to the Cross-Strait Services Trade Agreement.

It was largely a success which was then ratified by the head of the parliament. At the end of that year, the entire cabinet was like, “OK, we need to learn from the Occupiers.” 

* Are there cultural or political contexts where you think the Taiwanese approach would not translate well?

The risk of earthquakes in Taiwan is quite high, according to the United States. In Fact, Taiwan faces a similar risk of aggression.

* Looking back, are there pivotal moments where you could see yourself making a different decision and having your life / work go in a completely different direction?

On March 25, 2014, I took a leave of absence from SocialText and went to the demonstrators in the Legislative Yuan over the Internet. That was my first visit to the Legislative Yuan. Previously, beginning on March 18, when the masses took the Legislative Yuan, I was stationed outside the legislature to assist in maintaining the live broadcast.

Until my first face-to-face interaction with the activists on March 25, they merely thought of me as a dedicated netizen. As a consequence, as a g0v hacker, I was invited to the "NGO joint meeting" called by activists on April 7 to discuss the movement, which also provided as an opportunity for me to begin participating in public politics.

* Is there anything else you could divulge about your time in Silicon Valley? What was the company you created? Were there any particular people that stand out (good or bad)? Was there a pivotal moment that made you turn away from SV? 

Prior to joining the cabinet in 2016, I worked as a long-term consultant for three companies, including Apple, SocialText, and Oxford University, and I also have some short-term initiatives. Having said that, I didn't "turn away from SV" , even after retirement. To be more specific, I meant to devote more time to the social sector, therefore I spent more time in g0v and less time in Silicon Valley. This form of motivation stems from the fact that the g0v project is a lot of fun and may include thousands of people, making it far more interesting and satisfying than working on a single case alone.

* What transpired between SV and coming back to Taiwan? Was it immediate? 

As stated in the preceding question, I did not "turn away from SV," nor did I "return to Taiwan." It would be more appropriate to state that I did not "locate in SV," as I prefer to telework. Since 2008, all of my work in Silicon Valley has been done remotely. The biggest reason is that I dislike extended meetings. When the time zone was the same as my colleagues, there must have been meetings all the time.

The more advanced remote technology grows, the more time I spend in Taiwan. But I do the same thing no matter where I am.


* Did your time in Germany influence you in any way? 

I remember being very surprised that even when I enroll in the primary school…Because I’m not at the proficiency to attend a Gymnasium, and so I attended a Grundschule. Technically, my classmates are one year my junior, but they are very mature. They are almost like little adults.

When contrasted with the East Asian education system, which at that time was all about standardized answers and not at all about making their own decisions, it’s a striking difference.

I also remember that when I enrolled in the primary school, the teachers emphasized the idea of accountability, of taking one’s responsibility to one’s own, and also of the virtue of Pünktlichkeit. Punctuality, I think that’s the English.

So I start all my meetings with a kind of a ritualistic saying, saying, “we are starting this meeting a punctual way.”  I learned it in German, my teacher, Frau Wagner taught me when I was in Saarland.

* What were/are the main ingredients (ethos, philosophical, tradition, etc.) swirling around in your mind that most direct(ed) you?
