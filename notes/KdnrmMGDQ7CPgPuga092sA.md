You may not need an air conditioner in winter, but it is wise to run it for a few minutes every week. One point that you should take care of is the amount of time. Unknowingly, keeping your vehicle’s air conditioner properly set is an important part of car maintenance that could directly reduce the cost of future repairs.

Similar to the human body, an air conditioning system can freeze up and suffer from poor circulation if it is not in use extended periods of time.

It is important to keep the refrigerant liquid flowing and the system's parts lubricated because the air conditioner uses the oil for lubrication and a refrigerant for cooling.

Additionally, the HVAC system is very useful because it also serves as a dehumidifier. To be precise, a vehicle consists of an HVAC system, not just an air conditioner. It stands for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The whole system assists in dehumidification, ventilation, and cooling.

Therefore, you should not be content with just cooling the interior of your car. You can easily manage that humid condition for a better environment.

However, using your cooling system once a week for some time also keeps the air conditioner better in condition, so you can escape that costly car AC repair before summer begins.

A prolonged unused of an air conditioner seems like a rest for the most usable accessory in summer. But, eventually systems that have not been used frequently accumulate bacteria and mould, and when they are turned on, it is unpleasant.

Run your air conditioner in defrost mode for five to ten minutes to clear out extra moisture and stop mildew growth. This also stops unpleasant odours from growing in your car.

As there would be no need for any cooling, the air conditioner would have no use at all. But, you can run it on the defroster setting to clear the residual fog on your car’s windscreen. This function also keeps a part of the air conditioner under processing.

This usually comes in handy as fog is a major threat to drivers, especially in the winter. It can easily distract a driver on the road once there is no clear vision in front.
