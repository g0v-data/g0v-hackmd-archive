## Discussion
- How to prevent the problem that people wash the comments and try to manipulate the result? [name=josh]
    - Currrently, the detection machanism is focusing on domain name
    - Identification: using websties like rari.me to deal with the fake account and authenticate the users
    - Machine-learning can also helps too

- Question2 [name=allen]
    - How does it influce Youtube?
    - Ans: Will consider cooperate for research with Youtube in the future

- Suggestion: plugin for users to compare
- People are seeing global recommendation, but the bridging system can be further developed to fit into everyone

- User perspective: the positive side is to help users understand the large amount of content
    - balance: currently there is no balance and alternatives for users
- do you take likes from user as a metric for recommendation?[name=allen]
    - No, the users can only use the cursor to adjust the degree of recommendation
