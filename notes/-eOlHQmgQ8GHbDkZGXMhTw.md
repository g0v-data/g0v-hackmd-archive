## Intro

chihao has recieved an interview request from [IRI](https://www.iri.org/) and thinks it’s better to have the questions here so everyone can answer them.

chihao will be talking to people from IRI and reading the answers here to help them produce an episode of their podcast.

## Questions

### Could you provide a bit of background on what g0v is, how it came to be and what the basic principles of the g0v collective are?
> g0v hosted its first hackathon (hackath0n) at the end of 2012. (Photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/g0v/albums/72157711184894017).) [name=chihao]

### What’s g0v’s relationship like with the Taiwanese government?
> g0vers interact with our government in many different ways. For a community as large and diverse as g0v, this question is really difficult to summarize. [name=chihao]

### How does g0v harness the energy of volunteers to make the people the driver of solutions to the coronavirus?
> g0v’s bi-monthly hackathons (hosted by g0v jothon) are usually where volunteering contributors of g0v (g0vers) meet and hack out solutions to a variety of social issues. g0v also has a Slack workspace for any one to join and start a channel to discuss whatever they want to discuss (compliant with CoC and g0v Manifesto.) [name=chihao]

### What were some of the solutions that rose out of the g0v movement, and Taiwan’s approach to the open source movement?
> To name some of them: budget visualization, public property map, vTaiwan. [name=chihao]

### Why has Taiwan become such a success story in making technology work to democracy’s advantage, and what do you think that says about how other democracies can use technology in productive ways?

### How is g0v working with other countries to develop solutions to the Coronavirus?
