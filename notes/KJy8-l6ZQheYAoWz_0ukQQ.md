**Opportunities in electric vehicle adhesives market to keep increasing due to innovations in light-weight and sustainable materials**

Electric vehicle adhesives are specially prepared for research on lightweight and sustainable materials. With the urge for longer EV ranges, performance improvement is increasingly placing pressure on automakers to pay more attention to adhesives that make the application of lightweight composites possible with new materials. Besides, sustainability is showing ways increasingly to wider uses of bio-based adhesive solutions and recyclability that will help to meet global targets on the environment.

The pace of EV adoption is accelerating, while the potential of emerging markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America remains unexploited. Companies that have been heavily investing in R&D to develop value-added adhesive formulations meeting the emerging requirements will hold a key share in the market.

**Liquid adhesives dominated the electric vehicle adhesives market with 60% share in 2023.**

In the electric vehicle adhesives market, **liquid adhesives** held the largest share of 60% in 2023. The reason for this is that such adhesives are in wide demand due to their versatile usage, ease of application and high bonding potential for nearly all kinds of EV parts, which include batteries, motors and body assemblies. Liquids lead in this segment due to their wide diffusion in complicated bonding applications where both precision and strength are required.

**Film and tape adhesives**also have a significant market share because, due to their ease of use, they generally find adoption in everything from assembling battery packs to attaching sensors. Other forms, like **pastes and foamed adhesives**, address much niche applications for each to play the role of complementarity in diversified market demands.

**Asia Pacific led electric vehicle adhesives market with 42% of the market share in 2023, powered by robust EV production.**

In 2023, the share contributed by the Asia Pacific region in the electric vehicle adhesives market is the largest, at 42%, as most of the EV production in the world has occurred in this region so far, especially in China, which is the largest market for electric vehicles. This growth can also be attributed to the promotion of electric mobility by governments and multibillion-dollar investments in the related infrastructure of these vehicles.

The region also contains the key players in automotive manufacturing and adhesive supply, namely Japan and South Korea, which further solidifies its position. Regional growth is propelled by rapid urbanization and improving disposable income from the Asia Pacific and growing concern about the environment that is also driving its leading position in the electric vehicle adhesives market.
