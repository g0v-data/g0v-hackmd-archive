Gov doing a good job building platform in open knowledge
Question is "what kind of content"

Different evaluation process between civil soc. and gov
Gov indicators are not useful for the civil society

### Sri Lanka
Who owns the commitment
CS owns commitment (So is in Armenia)
Monitoring platform (by Transparency Intl)

### Mongolia
consultation process is to deliver ownership to gov, for them to understand
missing in Mongolia

### Sri Lanka
needs to identify what support can the cs deliver

### PNG
just approved NAP: 4 committment
public participation
foi
Transparency PGN + Treasury
whole gov is partnering with cs

### Armenia

funding is big problem to implement committment
"lets calculate"

### Kyrgyzstan
Did the calculation
gov stuck in the middle
politics sensative
gov change

3 committment by gov
open data
public procurment
crystal openness
all are plans already in place
committment to develop monitoring platform
but who would do it?

### PNG
4 commitment funded by gov
also intl donors

### Indonesia
shadow report

### Sri Lanka
dev of committment does not cost a lot of money
changes in processes, accessment in gov
platform, egov stuff more expensive
most gov department alloc. $
implement right to info funded by central gov

### Armenia
donor give $$ to gov
gov want to add things already doing to action plan but not ogp
2012 first action plan
cs stronger understanding to ogp values than gov
tries to push ogp values in each gov body
11/25 cs member in working group
rest gov

### Indonesia
new gov need time to explain
open parliament needed 4 years to make sure op is important

### Armenia
change of gov 6-7 times
change of point of contact

### Kyrgyzstan
Important to keep contact with implementation ppl not politician

New requirement of "repository" will help with institutional memory?

OGP Trust fund?

International mechanisms
OGP, SDG, EITI, International Budget Partnership (IBP), CEDAW...

### PNG
some good policy but not good implementation

### Sri Lanka
use ogp, participatory means for many kinds of reform


## Co-creation
work well
- making ogp an enabler for gov to achieve its own goal
- linking many things to SDG
- Indonesia & Pakistan CSO-gov coalition
- Indonesia ministries and CSO working on committement
- engage with sub-national bodies
- New Zealand, strong leadership from gov
- find key senior public servants

Want to do differently
- get more of gov
- normalize ogp as concept, platform
- build policy dev capacity in cs
- define ogp mtsh forum carefully
