- Abstract: The purpose of this project is to examine new and old civil group and its political actions in Taiwan. It will be an explore research that cover topics ranging over the activists’ personal histories, the groups in which they worked, their concepts of democracy and citizenship, their understanding of politics, party identity, political attitude and why they got involved in it. Second part in this project is explaining what difference things with new and old civil groups. This two year project focuses on political activists. First analysis period after 2008-9, also after TAIWAN Wild StrawBerries Movement(野草莓學運) in end of 2008, that be thought the first internet political action in Taiwan. I will interview three types of civil groups’ members: those involve in political initiative groups, like pttcitizen1985(公民1985 行動聯盟).Groups of independent reports, they report with its own point of view and use internet as alternative media, like civil media@ Taiwan(公民行動影音資料庫). Third type will be open data users group, volunteers fetch government public data and convert hard data to soft, friendly use, like g0v(零時政府). Three major methods will be used. The first method is to conduct intensive interviews on political activists to know the ways they perceive democracy, citizenship, their party identity, and why they got involved in it. I will interview activists from three types of new civil groups, and recruiting 30-40 cases per year. I will interview activists of old civil groups with same questions during the second project period and recruiting 30-40 interview cases too. The second method is observation of participant. I will join some groups’ meeting or political actions to observe group members’ interactive. The third method is a content analysis on groups’ public message to know groups preferences, choices and policy positions. I expect that we are watching a wave of civil group changed in Taiwan, new citizens become political activists, more kinds of political participation, and more alternative new media will bring more alternative political actions.

### 臺灣日常急診流量資料彙整與初步資料分析
- Data Cleansing and Analyzing of the Service Amount of Emergency Departments in Taiwan
- 作者：周雯淇
- 摘要：臺灣急診壅塞情形近年來日益嚴重，使得重症患者的緊急醫療面臨了嚴峻的考驗，醫院急診室無法拒絕自行就醫民眾，當重大意外傷害發生時，例如臺灣的高雄氣爆意外事故、八仙樂園彩色派對粉塵爆炸事故，湧入大量重度級傷病患時，珍貴的緊急醫療資源如何權衡分配。重度級急救責任醫院當被輕症求診民眾擠爆，原本該收治急重症患者的醫院也因此無法致力於急重症的處理，進一步造成急重症病患無病床可用的窘況。本篇研究以重度級急救責任醫院的急診指標資訊為基礎，蒐集臺灣急診室平常流量趨勢與資源使用狀況，希望藉此可以找出影響急診流量與資源使用狀況的影響因子。各重度級急救責任醫院的急診相關資料取自衛生福利部、政府開放平台，以及非營利民間組織g0v零時政府。我們進行了資料格式轉換，將台灣地區急診緊急醫療資訊建置於關聯式資料庫中。藉由這個資料庫，我們初步分析與探討全國各區域的重度級急救責任醫院在平日不同時段作的流量分布與可能成因。

- Abstract
    - Evolved from the hacker community, open source culture promote information transparency and public license, which allow people to obtain government information and oversee governance. People can communicate through online community, and collaborate to engage in politics. Open source culture and community collaboration not only enhance the autonomy of citizen, but also lowers the threshold for citizens to participate in public affairs. In view of this, this study chooses g0v for our case study, uses participatory observation and in-depth interviews to explore how open source culture community works to promote civic engagement though collaboration of g0v members.
    - Based on Clay Shirky’s theory of group action and elements of deliberation democracy from Weeks’, this study construct a model of "Sharing-Cooperation-Collective action" to interpret the implication of citizen participation in open source community. Through sharing information, cooperation to reach consensus and collective action to achieve the goal of the project, g0v participants translate public issues into open data, which is easy to access and understand. That helps to make citizens willing to pay attention to public affairs.
    - Compared with online deliberation, this study found that g0v also has diverse participants and equal chance to let every voice discuss. However, quality of deliberation in g0v collaboration is not stable. Representation of participant is often not enough is g0v project. Therefore, it’s hardly to guarantee the outcome of g0v projects is absolutely politically and practically feasible.
    - Compared with the traditional citizen participation methods, the requirement of public license enables all citizens to share collective wisdom, and speed up the process of overall social improvement. Also, decentralization empowers g0v participants high degree of autonomy, and make participants contribute with enthusiasm. Collaboration reduces the cost of civic engagement and expand the scale of participation. However, there are also bottlenecks in the g0v community''s participation model. The durability of citizen participation is unknown. Many projects doesn’t meet what citizens need, therefore fail to exert their influence and make society better.
    - Although citizen participation in open source community is not yet a mature model, g0v as a pioneer in bringing open-source technology and collaboration mechanisms to the public domain, has not only awakened citizens'' awareness of political participation, but also urged government to open public data, collaborate with the people , and set a precedent for initiating the project.

### Citizens, Politics, and Civic Technology: A Conversation with g0v and EDGI
- 作者：Fa‐ti Fan, S. Chen, Chia-Liang Kao, Michelle Murphy, M. Price, Liz Barry
- 摘要：We believe it’s important, in this special issue on citizen science, to hear the opinions, experiences, and voices of practitioners. After all, they are front and center in the movements discussed in these pages. For this reason, we invited several participants in two noted civic-tech communities—g0v and EDGI—to join a conversation about techbased activism or civic hacking. They were Chia-liang Kao from g0v, Michelle Murphy and Matt Price from EDGI, and Liz Barry, who has been instrumental in both EDGI and Public Lab, another civic-tech group.

### 立法問政、選區服務對議員連任影響之研究：以第12屆臺北市議會為例
- The Study on Relationships between Law-making, Constituency Service and Re-election of City Councilors: A Case Study of 12th Taipei City Council
- 作者：陳慧玲
- 摘要：既有理論指出，立法問政與選區服務是影響代議士是否連任的主要因素。藉由線上社群「g0v零時政府」所蒐整「Vote Taiwan投票指南」的數據資料，本研究以54位第12屆臺北市議員尋求連任第13屆臺北市議員為研究對象，主要自變項為議員在任內的立法問政（包括提案數、投票缺席率、議會缺席率與書面質詢）與選區服務（議員建議款），而連任成功與否及連任得票率為依變項。同時，為了解其他因素對議員連任的影響，並將議員個人因素（包括年齡、性別、從政資歷、政黨屬性）與所在選區規模做為控制變項。為了解各自變項對議員連任與否及連任得票率的影響程度，本研究分別以線性迴歸模型與二元羅吉斯迴歸模型進行分析。分析結果顯示，立法問政的各變項並未達統計上的顯著性，但在爭取越多的議員建議款，則可顯著地提高競選連任成功的機率。由於議員可運用資源從事選區服務，爭取建議款建設地方，因此，選民願以選票鼓勵其連任。本研究建議，議員從事各項選區服務之資訊應公開透明，諸如索資、會勘等，都應接受大眾檢驗，落實責任政治的民主原則。透過選區服務相關資訊之揭露，保障民眾知的權利，促使議員本於職責，妥善監督市政建設。

### 公民持續參與G0V開源社群之動機-以生存、聯結與成長為觀點 Motivations of Citizens' Continuous Participation in the G0V Open Source Community : From the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth Perspective.

- 研究成果：https://etheses.lib.ntust.edu.tw/cgi-bin/gs32/gsweb.cgi/ccd=ON3dO_/record?r1=1&h1=0
- 轉貼摘要：本研究發現，G0V社群參與者的持續參與動機，受生存、聯結與成長需求強烈影響。首先，社交與專案能力能增強參與動機，但個人生活型態對持續投入也可能產生阻礙。另外，數位公民在選擇是否持續參與，與他人的聯結感將會反應在社交互動上。當獲得成情感與社交支持時，會產生價值觀積極改變與作為。再者，當專案產出具有價值與影響力又能達成利他行為時，參與意願會因此提升。故強化社群成員間交流互動，除得鞏固個人參與動機，亦能產生自我實現的感受。

### 追求公眾利益：透過實務社群發展公民科技 In Search of Common Good: Civic Technology Development in a Community of Practice
- 計畫主持人：陳小芬
- 相關資訊：https://www.grb.gov.tw/search/planDetail?id=13879348
- 研究摘要：近年掀起一股公民科技的浪潮，公民科技運用開放資料、關注共眾利益，致力解決公共問題。公民科技由實務社群(Community of Practice)驅動，基於開源軟體的概念，將來自各個領域的志願者聚集起來。永續發展和持續的民眾參與是公民實務社群的關鍵議題，為此，成功的公民科技社群需要精心設計的社群結構和流程以鼓勵公民參與並促進合作。本研究旨在探討公民科技社群採用的結構與協作流程的核心要素，以Wenger的實務社群理論來闡釋個案及發展研究架構。本研究以臺灣著名公民科技社群「g0v零時政府」為研究個案，進行個案研究。g0v為全球前三大開源社群，本研究透過訪談及社開大量豐富之開會記錄、Podcast及刊物等資料，探究g0v如何設計其結構，以支持社群參與者在處理公共問題時能支援社群成員建立共享的目標、社群認同、價值傳統、學習和公共實務的持續性發展。本研究以實務社群的觀點，並藉由個案闡釋探討及推導公民科技社群的運作。本研究結果將能協助民眾、政府和企業了解並學習這種自我治理的有機體所帶來的管理意涵及價值。

- Dissertation Topic Outline: 

The research is expected to investigate 'Cross-disciplinary to Cross-cultural Communication in G0V', exploring the culture of g0v as a civic technology community and cross-cultural communication with members of civic communities in other countries.

'g0v' is a local grassroots civic community in Taiwan, dedicated to promoting an open and collaborative 'decentralised project operation model' that has attracted many citizens to participate. Through civic technology and open-source collaboration, g0v aims to build and improve Taiwan's civic environment, while promoting civic participation in social issues and influencing the policy of the government, creating a bottom-up force for citizens to affect government policy.

As the civic technology and open-source collaborative culture of the g0v community grows, exchanges between g0v and the international community are becoming more frequent, opening up many events and meetings with civic technology communities in other countries. This paper will focus on how citizens can integrate and participate in the open-source collaborative culture of g0v, and then how they can reach a consensus and collaborate on specific issues when interacting with members of other countries' civic tech communities beneath the cultural differences.

### Checking Facts by a Bot - Crowdsourced Facts and Intergenerational Care in Posttruth Taiwan

- Mei-chun Lee
- 
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/730621
- Abstract: From the discussion of “posttruth” in 2016 to the “infodemic” in 2020, online rumors seem to have become more rampant, harmful, and harder to be debunked. This article examines Cofacts, a Taiwan-based fact-checking service that combines a chatbot and a database of fact-checked responses provided by volunteers to help debunk rumors circulated on the messaging app LINE. I argue that Cofacts’s crowdsourcing approach joins what Donna Haraway calls embodied objectivity that insists on “the particularity and embodiment of all vision” to challenge the conventional fact-checking practice that presumes singularity, disembodied objectivity, and authority. Underpinning Cofacts’s fight against online rumors is the intergenerational conflicts that are ingrained in different life experiences, beliefs and values, and expectations of what a good life is. By taking up a technological solution that emphasizes openness, Cofacts opens a space for digital natives to contest what fact is and claim the power of speaking from their parents and the patriarchal society on the one hand and to forge new connections of care and reinitiate conversations that have been barred by the invisible walls of chat rooms and the widening gap of values and beliefs between generations on the other hand.
- 中文摘要：從2016年「post-truth」的討論到2020年的「infodemic」，網絡謠言似乎變得更加猖獗、有害且難以駁斥。本文探討了Cofacts，一個台灣的事實查核服務，它結合了聊天機器人和由編輯志工提供的事實查核資料庫，來幫助查核在LINE上流傳的謠言。我主張，Cofacts的眾包方法結合了Donna Haraway所稱的即身客觀性 (embodied objectivity)，這種客觀性堅持，知識都有其視角與身體，從來就非普世皆同。透過群眾外包的事實查核機器人，Cofacts從而挑戰傳統事實查核中，認為事實是單一、客觀的並且具有權威的觀點。Cofacts誕生於台灣不同世代之間的衝突，這些衝突源於不同的生活經歷、信仰和價值觀，以及對美好生活的期望。通過採取強調開放性的技術解決方案，Cofacts為數位原住民打開新的政治空間，一方面他們可以在父家長的社會中爭奪對事實的話語權；另一方面，Cofacts的眾包方法也讓數位原住民之間建立新的關懷聯繫，並重新開始因同溫層和世代對立而被阻礙的世代對話。
