[01:57:09 - 01:57:31]

**Peter:**
I'd like to add that even for a huge company like OpenAI, they actually encounter some difficulties in obtaining localized data. For instance, when we participated in this project, we had the opportunity to attend some lectures organized by OpenAI. In fact, at a lecture I attended the Friday before last, OpenAI mentioned an issue they are dealing with

[01:57:31 - 01:57:55]

**Peter:**
which is the political stance reflected in their various language models. However, the data related to their language models actually comes from sources like the Pew Research Center and other major polling firms that survey American citizens. During the Q&A session, I asked why they only focus on the United States, and they simply replied that it’s because they can't find reliable polling data from other countries to replicate

[01:57:55 - 01:58:19]

**Peter:**
their research methodology. They are actually trying hard to secure the relevant resources to do so. So, it’s known that even large companies like OpenAI, which is not very large as it's a startup, but I mean companies developing artificial intelligence, might all encounter this kind of difficulty with localization. This is something everyone can be aware of. Currently, are there others who want to speak? A-Gan, you wanted to say something?

[01:58:20 - 01:58:43]

**Peter:**
Then A-Gan, and after that, let's see if there are others. Okay, no problem. After A-Gan, it's Teemo.

**A-Gan:**
Sorry, I still want to clarify the ethical standards here. Does it mean that after we give suggestions, it will become the ethical standard for OpenAI's future products, or does it refer to the content generated and the ethical standards in various places, like in the Asian region,

[01:58:43 - 01:59:06]

**A-Gan:**
even in Taiwan, and then in South and North America? I'm a bit confused about who exactly these ethical standards are regulating.

**Peter:**
The ethical standards, it should be said here, are related to issues of AI localization and ethical content, so we've categorized it into this set. But it doesn't mean that the discussions here will only be feedback for

[01:59:06 - 01:59:28]

**Peter:**
OpenAI to use as a reference for setting ethical standards. It's just the label of the issue. The way we categorize it is through this method of classification. I hope this answers your question.

**A-Gan:**
Okay, no problem. Let's start by saying, just now I agreed with what Guizhi said. I think the left side and the right side are actually different levels of problems. For instance, regarding human rights,

[01:59:29 - 01:59:52]

**A-Gan:**
for issues similar to question 58, I almost always choose to refuse to answer. It's not because I think OpenAI should or shouldn't make these judgments, but actually, you will find that if we emphasize localization and the importance of local context, yet worry that excessive localization will create too high a homogeneity,

[01:59:52 - 02:00:14]

**A-Gan:**
then it becomes a situation where you can't hear voices from other places at all. So, actually, I believe it also responds to what the host said at the beginning about some problems most people refuse to answer. I usually refuse to answer because I think it's too complicated and can't be expressed in just a few sentences. Thank you.

**Peter:**
Yes, thank you. And now we saw that Teemo wanted to respond to the previous participants' opinions. Please go ahead.
[02:00:16 - 02:00:40]

**Teemo:**
I hope that OpenAI can democratize its moderation, its content arbitration, allowing everyone to directly establish their own mechanisms. Like Taiwan's BBS, where people set their own board rules and decide on the content of these rules and how to regulate and adjust the board. Thus, creating their own subculture and regulations.

[02:00:40 - 02:01:03]

**Teemo:**
From my perspective, as an LGBTQ member and a Hakka laborer, I feel that if OpenAI had existed ten years before marriage equality and could have told me on Twitter that two people are in a couple relationship, I would have been very upset.

[02:01:03 - 02:01:25]

**Teemo:**
After OpenAI's emergence, it should immediately alert the community of such uses that may be dangerous. So, if it could tell us about a couple relationship on Twitter, if this happened in the ten years after marriage equality, I think there would be no problem. You know, it's because the times have changed with the flow of time.

[02:01:25 - 02:01:47]

**Teemo:**
The information we feed it now, has it evolved with the times? I'm really curious. So, this ethical standard and localization might not apply at a certain point in time but might apply in the future. Therefore, I hope they open up content arbitration to be democratic and adjustable.

[02:01:47 - 02:02:09]

**Teemo:**
And open up the community to participate in the democratic process.

**Peter:**
Teemo mentioned a point, which is why we should adopt a democratic approach to govern ethical standards. Perhaps it's because of different time points and different places, and therefore it's not suitable to use a possibly related method to establish a consistent standard. Now, does anyone want to respond to the opinions raised by the previous participants?

[02:02:09 - 02:02:33]

**Peter:**
Anyone? I just saw... okay, RR raised his hand again.

**RR:**
I want to clarify that I think the distinction and definition between Issues Two and Three are good and pose no problem. However, for me, the solutions might not differ significantly between Issues Two and Three.

[02:02:33 - 02:02:56]

**RR:**
They just represent different aspects. But I believe the fundamental thinking should theoretically be the same. Because sometimes, discrimination and localization might seem like the same thing to some people, right? So, I think the approach to handling this could refer to the discussions we've had before, or say, for a large company like OpenAI that wants to face the global market, they could set up

[02:02:56 - 02:03:18]

**RR:**
some kind of switch, like I want a display mode that fits localization. For example, I am currently in Taiwan, or they can specify a place or a certain culture, and then handle it accordingly.

**Peter:**
Okay, RR suggests that perhaps through a selection method, users could choose to observe more localized content or less localized content. I'm not sure if

[02:03:18 - 02:03:42]

**Peter:**
there are other participants or those online who would like to respond to the opinions just raised, or would like to comment on the aspects of the issue presented here. If not, I may want to sneakily use the host's prerogative to push some participants who haven't spoken yet or haven't had a chance to speak

[02:03:42 - 02:04:05]

**Peter:**
to express their views. Do we have anyone? If not, let me check. If possible, I would like to ask Professor Liu Changde or Teacher Zhang Zheng for their opinion on this issue.

[02:04:05 - 02:04:29]

**Peter:**
Because they come from backgrounds such as technology, media, or immigration, I think it would be great if we could hear your opinions.

**Liu Changde:**
I don't know if I have entered the discussion context, but I did hear what I think was Teemo talking about the democratic principle of localization ethical standards.

[02:04:29 - 02:04:51]

**Liu Changde:**
I personally agree with this principle. What I want to raise now might be the difficulty in operation, that is, imagining the process like PTT at that time is quite different from what OpenAI is doing now, for example, with language generation models

[02:04:51 - 02:05:14]

**Liu Changde:**
These are large-scale, multinational practices. I think it's quite unlikely that we, as a small community, can slowly derive the subcultural board rules we hope to see. For example, if we now talk about China's Chat GPT

[02:05:14 - 02:05:37]

**Liu Changde:**
There might be some keywords that locals think can or cannot be discussed. If in the past with PTT, I think PTT was relatively a grassroots, bottom-up approach. But now, if I'm in China, I'm just imagining, in Taiwan, I think

[02:05:37 - 02:06:00]

**Liu Changde:**
there would be a similar situation when we want to decide what things in this language model can or cannot appear. There might be too many different large forces, whether political or capital, coming in to interfere. It's not a grassroots culture that slowly forms over time to let this group of people decide, especially when this group has strong wills. In this part, I think there might be a little difficulty. Thank you, for your reference.

[02:06:00 - 02:06:23]

**Peter:**
So, teacher, sorry, the microphone here, please use the wireless microphone.

**Zhang Zheng:**
Sorry, I and Changde were late, so we may not have gotten into it. I just listened to the last part of issue two about new residents. Actually, I have some thoughts because that, I also don't know who wrote it, but I hope the new residents

[02:06:23 - 02:06:45]

**Zhang Zheng:**
aren't put together with foreign laborers. This is similar to a book I was reading about Chinese workers in South Africa. Their protest was, "Don't put me together with black people," because they were speaking to white people, saying "Don't put us together with black people, we are different." In fact, everyone may be discriminated against, but what I heard earlier, like what Gui Zhi said, I think it still

[02:06:46 - 02:07:08]

**Zhang Zheng:**
makes a lot of sense. It's not that this reflects reality. I think what Gui Zhi said earlier was very smart. It's precisely because of this reality that the existence of discrimination or categorization can be proved. And from this, we should think about how to change. Of course, I don't really know

[02:07:08 - 02:07:32]

**Zhang Zheng:**
how much power OpenAI has to do this. Just OpenAI or GPT-like features should have some of their own missions. Maybe today they are collecting everyone's opinions, but is it possible that it sounds like they are collecting everyone's opinions

[02:07:32 - 02:07:54]

**Zhang Zheng:**
to then do something. But I believe the organizers, or now popularly called the main handlers, might have their own opinions. I'm quite optimistic about it. I think it depends on how they push forward. I also believe that they can't just be trusted easily, but I optimistically think it should still be possible. Thank you.

[02:07:54 - 02:08:18]

**Peter:**
Alright, it seems Teacher Zhang Zheng is someone with a more optimistic perspective. Regarding issue three, does anyone else wish to respond? It seems like Shen Han would like to say something.

**Hong Shen Han:**
I actually agree very much. In fact, I think issues two and three have an inherently similar logic.

[02:08:18 - 02:08:42]

**Hong Shen Han:**
Because they both deal with a production process where a more hegemonic or mainstream phenomenon might occur. I think the logic is the same. But to be honest, I have reservations about letting a technological tool make value judgments, or it's not my preferred approach when we first encounter a problem.

[02:08:42 - 02:09:05]

**Hong Shen Han:**
To let tech companies make value judgments, I think this would create a lot of risks. The example of Meta that everyone has brought up is one such case. There are many more examples that could be raised. Now, of course, it depends on how one understands this AI. Some people understand this AI

[02:09:05 - 02:09:29]

**Hong Shen Han:**
as a kind of concentration or projection or magnification of various social realities. That's one way to understand it, or it actually might lead to some sort of qualitative change. Of course, on this part, I might also want to ask more technical workers whether it might actually transform something in here, not just a concept of magnification or projection.

[02:09:29 - 02:09:52]

**Hong Shen Han:**
I don't understand this as well as everyone else, but I still want to say that I indeed do not tend towards making some, especially through the filters of tech companies, because the bias that ultimately appears, I feel, would be even larger, or even further away from the kind of democracy we originally hoped for, a more principled democracy.

[02:09:52 - 02:10:15]

**Hong Shen Han:**
This is what I'm worried about.

**Peter:**
Before we continue to schedule further comments, I want to add an opinion that an online participant brought up. The contributor identified themselves as Hui Ying, and they said, "The discrimination presented in question 28 does not come from AI but from the commenters who think new residents equal foreign labor and workers."

[02:10:15 - 02:10:37]

**Peter:**
And said that AI should not deepen stereotypes, but their comments are discriminating against another group. Although the term new residents is used more than marriage immigrants in Taiwan, new residents is a complex concept. Migrant workers and foreign students are also new residents of Taiwan. Open AI's data will need to be more finely localized and complete.

[02:10:37 - 02:11:06]

**Peter:**
This is an opinion provided by an online participant on Slido. Sorry, hello, sorry, yes, yes, alright. Do you want to add anything else with the microphone? Okay, thank you. Any other, sorry, please.

**Dai Yu Hui:**
We should avoid

[02:11:06 - 02:11:29]

**Dai Yu Hui:**
homogenizing new residents or any group. Like when I used to work with the homeless, some would emphasize that they are clean, not dirty as everyone assumes. But in fact, there are very complex internal psychological mechanisms because the entire society is constantly stigmatizing this group.

[02:11:29 - 02:11:51]

**Dai Yu Hui:**
So some homeless people really want to integrate into mainstream society, and they would emphasize that they are clean, etc. It's like some homosexuals, when fighting for rights, would say we pay taxes, so why don't we have these rights. But in fact, there are rich and poor within the homosexual community,

[02:11:51 - 02:12:13]

**Dai Yu Hui:**
there is a class difference. So going back to our third issue, it's a common theme, what you call localization, but it involves globalization, and then various national and community laws and regulations. But the community is not uniform,

[02:12:13 - 02:12:36]

**Dai Yu Hui:**
not a homogenous concept, there are different opinions. So suppose within each country, they may consider homosexuality illegal. So if they respect localization, do they say the law on homosexuality is illegal? And so on. So we may have to go back to

[02:12:36 - 02:13:00]

**Dai Yu Hui:**
our discussion on universal human rights. The fifth question reflects what Teacher Changde just mentioned. We probably all know that the Chinese government has established the famous Great Firewall. So actually, the premise is that if you, a multinational company, want to do business there, you have to first accept their censorship system,

[02:13:00 - 02:13:22]

**Dai Yu Hui:**
their system. Then you can go in. And in fact, it's not up to the citizens of China to decide whether they have the right to filter that keyword. So we may need to be careful, do individuals have that much right?

**Peter:**
Thank you. Are there any other participants who would like to speak to this part? I saw PBS seemed to have a frown, looking like they wanted to express an opinion.

[02:13:22 - 02:13:46]

**Peter:**
Would anyone like to speak on this? I saw PBS seemed to have a frown, perhaps wanting to express their opinion.

**PBS:**
Okay, I have been thinking a lot because, as someone involved in, well let me put it this way, after Chat GPT was released, actually in Taiwan, whether it's Taiwan Smart Cloud or some other, and some tech companies

[02:13:46 - 02:14:08]

**PBS:**
they also launched an enterprise version, what they call the Taiwan version of Chat GPT. And on the enterprise end, everyone talks because actually Taiwan's hardware is pretty strong. They would say Taiwan's hardware can support such software. But actually, looking at this group of developers and interacting with them, I actually had a big question mark because in this industry when you see them developing

[02:14:08 - 02:14:31]

**PBS:**
it's quite clear to feel that they actually don't have much sense about the related issues. So when we discuss human rights today or, as some have mentioned earlier, whether citizens or users have the right to decide and participate in this process, there is actually a big gap with reality. I have to say, so I think this gap might be a bit beyond the issue.

[02:14:31 - 02:14:53]

**PBS:**
The issue itself is framed as whether we should have such engagement in it. I think it should be modified, but in reality, there are still difficulties in implementation. How to manage it might be the next step for everyone to work on. Thank you.

**Peter:**
Participants on site or online,

[02:14:53 - 02:15:18]

**Peter:**
does anyone wish to express their opinion? Online participants, if you have any opinions to express, you are welcome to raise your hands and we will let you speak. Because we have not heard from anyone raising their hands so far, it seems like we have yet to hear from online participants. However, if anyone has any opinions or views on the content just discussed, please feel free to present them. Now, does anyone onsite wish to share or express their thoughts on the opinions raised by PBS

[02:15:18 - 02:15:40]

**Peter:**
or any other participants regarding localization? Okay, if not, then our event today is about to reach

[02:15:40 - 02:16:04]

**Peter:**
the final stage, which will be a summary by the moderator. And actually, to be honest, the summary won't take as long as 15 minutes. So, I actually hope that participants who have not yet spoken will have a chance to speak in this final stage. So I've been paying attention to

[02:16:04 - 02:16:26]

**Peter:**
participants onsite who may not have spoken yet, including YY. And I wonder if we could start with you, just to express any overall opinions, and so on.

**YY:**
Hello everyone. Actually, last Wednesday or Thursday in my line of work, I was organizing some data. Now personally, I am also in a state of conflict and complexity.

[02:16:26 - 02:16:49]

**YY:**
Because as just mentioned, whether it's data ethics or issues of bias, my initial thought was that if we dare not touch it, then we provide some objective, some quantitative analysis data. But after three minutes, I was thinking to myself that this is somewhat limiting the development of AI. If you are only doing data analysis,

[02:16:49 - 02:17:11]

**YY:**
many tools can already do that. My AI doesn't need to develop further. So if we first impose some subjective definitions and restrictions on some issues, I personally have a bit of conflict about the development of AI. Because I just introduced myself and mentioned that

[02:17:11 - 02:17:34]

**YY:**
I am actually happy to see AI improve the efficiency or effectiveness of human development. So I have some personal conflicts about too many restrictions. Therefore, like what was just mentioned, whether it's data privacy or restrictions, when everyone was discussing it, I suddenly thought that everyone is talking about different aspects. Like someone at the beginning was talking about training with personal data,

[02:17:34 - 02:17:57]

**YY:**
it's used in what's called a training phase. Some are in the usage phase, or how my personal data is protected to comply with data protection laws, or I have the right to be forgotten. These are different aspects of discussion. So I was thinking that a discussion like this needs to be more finely cut or discussed on different levels. Otherwise, such scattered discussion is something I was also thinking about when I wanted to make a comment.

[02:17:57 - 02:18:19]

**YY:**
I couldn't express myself because I am in conflict, my own head is in conflict. Thank you.

**Peter:**
Thank you for the opinion YY. Next, it seems if we go to the second row, Jenny, let's see if Vanessa

[02:18:19 - 02:18:42]

**Peter:**
can share your views on today's meeting or event, or your thoughts on AI issues like regionalization, discrimination, or protecting personal information and data. I think you could write your views in English.

[02:18:42 - 02:19:05]
**Peter:**
We will try to translate when we actually do the recording. Okay?

[02:19:05 - 02:19:29]
**Vaness:**
I think, I see a lot of possibilities and potential, such as international exchanges and understanding, but I also worry...

[02:19:29 - 02:19:52]
**Vaness:**
about how to enable small groups with little data to be represented. Culture is a very complex subject with many layers. How can it be achieved, for example, if my dream is realized...

[02:19:56 - 02:20:19]
**Peter:**
Okay, thank you. The next person who may not have given their opinion yet is Ms. Hung Man-Chih. Would you like to say something? Sorry.

[02:20:19 - 02:20:47]
**Hung Man-Chih:**
Yes, it seems my opinion is similar to what Hui Ying just expressed...

**Hung Man-Chih:**
and the person before that, so I feel there's no need for me to repeat it again.

[02:20:47 - 02:21:15]
**Peter:**
Okay, thank you. Next, might be Mariko. Thank you. Do you have any opinions?

**Mariko:**
Thank you. Sorry, I suddenly joined this meeting. Apologies, because I don't understand Taiwanese well, so I'm not very clear on the content of the discussion, but everyone is discussing very earnestly. It's okay. Thank you, thank you.

[02:21:16 - 02:21:45]
**Peter:**
So, our friends from Japan, together. Sorry, thank you. So, thank you.

[02:21:45 - 02:22:09]
**Unnamed Japanese Participant1:**
Excuse me, excuse me, I'm also from Tokyo. My name is Takenaka. I just happened to come here. Right now, we're doing a survey on Taiwan, quite the island, VTaiwan.

[02:22:09 - 02:22:31]
**Unnamed Japanese Participant2:**
I just happened to come here and learned that this is a corner of the VTaiwan discussion.

**Unnamed Japanese Participant2:**
I am very moved and very interested in listening. Thank you very much, thank you.

[02:22:31 - 02:22:57]
**Peter:**
Next, how about the person in glasses, the one in yellow clothes, yes yes, can you introduce yourself since you came in a bit later?

**Zhiyuan:**
I came a bit late, I'm Zhiyuan, and I'm currently a graduate student at the National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Building and Planning.

[02:22:57 - 02:23:19]
**Zhiyuan:**
At the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning. I might be a bit different from this topic, but I came late and have been thinking, actually, just joining in midway through, sorry. But mainly in understanding some, what I was actually thinking about is what we want it to do, this thing is reflecting the current state of society.

[02:23:19 - 02:23:41]
**Zhiyuan:**
But actually, a long time ago, whenever new media first came out, there would always be a similar discussion. And I was just thinking, I don't have a complete thought, only feeling that, like I just saw that thing about the formation of white sand in the West, we of course would expect there to be more diverse things, saying we focus on a very marginal variety of things but I would really hope...

**Zhiyuan:**
that various other things are seen, but in the market, this thing will still continue to happen. To what extent we should intervene in this matter is what I was just thinking about. Thank you, everyone.

[02:23:41 - 02:24:03]
**Peter:**
Okay, thank you Zhiyuan. The lady next to Zhiyuan, sorry, it seems like you didn't get much chance to speak earlier, please go ahead.

**Sophie:**
Hello everyone, I am Sophie.

[02:24:03 - 02:24:25]
**Sophie:**
So, jumping out of these three to summarize my thoughts, GPT seems like that mud monster in 'Spirited Away', doesn't it? It eats a lot of things and is constantly fed by all of humanity's users. What it will grow into is a result of the content we feed it. During this generation stage on this platform...

[02:24:25 - 02:24:48]
**Sophie:**
each one of us is a contributor, a user, and potentially a victim. So in this process, I think we should also explore what exactly GPT's responsibility as a platform is. An occasion like today's is great, we have a channel to solicit opinions. Shouldn't the platform itself also establish an open public...

[02:24:48 - 02:25:11]
**Sophie:**
channel for collecting opinions, so we can input what we consider universal values, local culture, inappropriate ethical norms, or our hopes for how future humanity can be better through an open window of a platform? Therefore, the platform's responsibility and its mechanism to embrace public opinion...

**Sophie:**
should also be required to be established. That's all, thank you, thank you.

[02:25:11 - 02:25:33]
**Peter:**
So it seems that everyone here has had at least one opportunity to speak. I would like to ask our online friends about today's meeting. I wonder if we could invite those online like Sanya, Zhengxiang, and others, especially since Zhengxiang hasn't yet spoken about the agenda nor has Wendy.

[02:25:34 - 02:25:58]
**Peter:**
If it's not too much trouble, could we invite Zhengxiang to share his thoughts? If Zhengxiang is not ready, that's okay.

**Peter:**
Then Sanya, sorry to bother you, could we invite you to speak? Okay.

**Sanya:**
Because actually, we have been sharing some thoughts secretly in the Meet chat window since today. Everyone's ideas are such that we feel like we could think more. It's really not easy to organize a coherent statement at this time. Personally, I think this meeting...

[02:25:58 - 02:26:20]
**Sanya:**
...can inspire a lot of ideas. Later on, we will find that there are so many things we can think about differently. Sometimes our too common thoughts limit our imagination. This is just like my participation in the labor rights movement. Sometimes we just need to exchange ideas with different people. Like even some friends have made me realize that I could actually get off work on time.

[02:26:20 - 02:26:43]
**Sanya:**
Such a realization. I think in today's venue, we just have such kinds of inspiration. Of course, the issues that are sparked cannot possibly be dealt with online or in a short time. But I believe that when everyone has such a seed in their heart, it will guide the future development of AI...

[02:26:43 - 02:27:09]
**Sanya:**
...in a better direction. This is my personal reflection for today. Thank you.

**Peter:**
Thank you, Sanya. Now, may we invite Wendy or Zhengxiang to share their thoughts or views? Wendy, are you ready? Or is Zhengxiang available now? Okay.

**Peter:**
Sorry to bother you, Wendy. Please go ahead.

**Wendy:**
Sorry, I'll just briefly share my personal thoughts here. Currently, whether it's Chat GPT or other large language models, the related data they use are actually obtained from the internet or elsewhere...

[02:27:33 - 02:27:56]
**Wendy:**
...publicly available data for training. But since the explosive growth of OpenAI's GPT last year, more and more people are paying attention to whether the content generated meets everyone's expectations or encompasses various values.

[02:27:56 - 02:28:21]
**Wendy:**
I think a model of public participation in discussions, like what we have today, or even future large language model development companies, could establish a similar participation and opinion integration system, along with data collection, to reflect on the values to be incorporated. Then, it can be fed back into these large language model companies...

[02:28:21 - 02:28:44]
**Wendy:**
...to guide the subsequent training of these large language models with certain directions and standards. I believe that the future development of AI generation will not be dominated by capitalism or commercialism, but I hope...

[02:28:44 - 02:29:07]
**Wendy:**
...that the future development can be more balanced. Thank you.

**Peter:**
Thank you, Wendy. Finally, is Zhengxiang able to share?

[02:29:07 - 02:29:31]
**Zhengxiang:**
Is my voice coming through? Yes, it is, very clear. I really appreciate Jia Wei for organizing this event and everyone for sharing many topics in the middle.

**Peter:**
Thank you, Zhengxiang. I would also like to clarify that it wasn't me who organized this event, but it was organized with the V Taiwan community participants...

[02:29:31 - 02:29:53]
**Peter:**
...and all the staff present here. Everyone from guiding the entire venue to reporting, even the timing just now, online agenda assistants who helped with organizing opinions, photographers who took beautiful pictures for everyone, the host partners, and the backstage staff who helped us with filming and live streaming...

Ren Xiang and his partners actually played a very important role in this event. This is actually the spirit of V Taiwan: in the whole process of V Taiwan, no matter what your position is, whether you are sitting in the audience providing opinions as a participant or participating online from afar, or helping with the process on-site, everyone is a very important part of the whole process.

[02:30:15 - 02:30:39]
**Peter:**
I also hope to take this opportunity, using a bit of my privilege as the host, to thank everyone, and I hope we can give a round of applause to thank all the staff involved today. Thank you, everyone. Well, I think this actually fits quite well as a summary for today. Many opinions were raised today, and many deserve further exploration, but unfortunately, we are not holding a marathon discussion...

[02:30:39 - 02:31:02]
**Peter:**
...we do not need to come up with a definitive answer today. But we hope that the discussions of today, when compiled, can continue to ferment in other places and even lead to further discussions. If you are interested, I also want to take this chance to advertise that if you are interested, you are welcome to scan the smaller QR Code because V Taiwan might organize other opinion collection...

...are all open and transparent, with the exception of content involving private data. Basically, everything is open and transparent, and those who bring up discussions and related credit are recognized. So thank you very much for participating today. This concludes our event for today. The rest of the time is for everyone to freely network. Thank you everyone, and before you leave, you might want to consider...

...checking the last anonymous question, which includes issues of discrimination. These issues may have already exceeded the framework of Taiwan and pertain to the international reality, where Taiwan's voice is also suppressed within large language models like OpenAI. In this situation, the discussion might be about how Taiwan can break through the current predicament to make large companies like OpenAI...

[02:32:10 - 02:32:34]
**Peter:**
We hope to allow the use of data and information that is believed by the cultural community, new residents, and the majority of the Taiwanese people in large language models like OpenAI. This is indeed what we hoped to achieve in holding this consultation meeting, to ensure that our voices, at least as a selected team, are relatively louder compared to other teams around the world that were not selected. We can use such an opportunity to bring our voices into...

[02:32:34 - 02:32:57]
**Peter:**
...OpenAI and into these large language models, and also through the existing mechanisms of V Taiwan to establish the relevant frameworks. Okay, if there are any more questions, we welcome them. Our online link will remain open, so please feel free to use it to add any issues we did not discuss today. This concludes our event for today, and we have prepared beverages because it's really hot today, so drinks are available for everyone. Why distribute them after the meeting? Because eating and drinking are prohibited here.

[02:32:57 - 02:33:03]
**Peter:**
So, everyone is welcome to ask the staff outside for drinks after the meeting. Thank you all for coming today. Thank you, everyone.
