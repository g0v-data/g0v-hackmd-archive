Football odds can vary quite a bit between different bookmakers so it's worth shopping around. I usually check a few sites before placing bigger bets to see who's offering the best value. Live betting is where things get really interesting because the odds shift so quickly based on what's happening in the game. You need to be quick with your decisions though. Bonuses can be helpful but I always read the terms carefully because some have really high rollover requirements. The registration process should be straightforward when you're getting started.
