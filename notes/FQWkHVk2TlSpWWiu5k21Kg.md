Been obsessing over fantasy hair colors lately and [blue ombre hair](https://glaminati.com/fairy-blue-ombre-hair-beautiful-girls/) keeps calling to me! There's something so magical about how it transitions from dark roots to ocean-like blues at the ends. My hairdresser showed me different options - from subtle navy to teal gradients, all the way to bright electric blue tips. The coolest part is how versatile it is. You can go mermaid vibes with turquoise tones or more edgy with cobalt and sapphire shades. She said the key is starting with pre-lightened hair for the blue to really pop. Maintenance sounds intense though - apparently blue fades faster than other colors and needs special shampoo to prevent it turning green. Still tempted to take the plunge!
