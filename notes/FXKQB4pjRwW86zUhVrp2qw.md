# Top Front-end Frameworks in 2024
With optimal performance and safety aims, Rust is increasingly utilized in website creation, including the front end. The landscape is mainly occupied by JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular; however, contrary to their dominance, there are also various Rust-based front-end frameworks. The high performance levels they boast of, together with their strong typing capacities and memory safety guarantees make them an excellent choice for constructing contemporary web apps.

In the year 2024, various Rust front-end frameworks have distinct features and capabilities. The article highlights several Rust front-end frameworks specifically Yew, Seed, Percy, Sauron, and Dioxus. Developers need to select among these tools as per their requirements thus the article provides an elaborate comparison of these frameworks including their strengths weaknesses and use cases. Furthermore, we will address how front-end developers can incorporate this framework with already existing tools and enhance performance in web applications.

## Yew
You can build modern web apps with Yew, which is a framework based on components and was inspired by JavaScript frameworks such as React. This framework allows you to create dynamic, responsive and fast front-end web applications in an easy way.

### Strengths
Yew’s framework resembles that of React thus allowing developers accustomed to developing based on components to easily switch over. They embrace logic, rendering as well as states doing away with repetitive codes and achieving modularity within them. App speed and efficacy are guaranteed thanks to Rust’s compile-time optimizations together with its memory management practices. The framework employs Shallow and Tall structures that are similar to Rust's zero-cost abstractions alongside its powerful concurrency model to come out with very effective web applications. Yew also has Rust’s strong typing system which oversees many errors at compilation time thus lowering the odds of running time bugs hence more dependable and easy to maintain code results from this twist in operations.

Even if Yew’s ecosystem is smaller than that of JavaScript, it keeps growing at a steady pace. There are several types of libraries and tools within it that make things easier during the development process; for instance, routing, state management, and component libraries. One of the best things about Yew applications is that they compile to WebAssembly so that they can be executed in browsers almost as fast as native code would be executed. Because of this reason, Yew can also be used for applications where performance is crucial.

### Limitations
Yew has a smaller community in comparison with JavaScript frameworks. Fewer third-party libraries, plugins, and community-driven resources such as tutorials and forums may come from this. Developers who are just starting to use Rust may find it difficult due to its learning curve. To use Yew effectively, one must understand Rust’s ownership model, borrowing and lifetimes. However, the tooling and ecosystem surrounding Yew are less developed than those for javascript frameworks. This might imply that there are not many out-of-the-box solutions provided for standard operations.

### Use Cases
SPAs or Single-Page Applications are best suited for Yew, which allows loading of dynamic content without refreshing the entire page. Its component-based structure aids in handling the complexities of large applications better. Additionally, Yew creates highly interactive GUIs that demand in-time updates through user actions; thus providing a smooth browsing experience because of its performance benefits over other web technologies. The efficiency and performance of Yew are suitable for applications that require real-time data updates such as chat applications or live dashboards.

### Front-end Utilization
Yew can develop web applications that are dynamic in structure and syntax like React. By defining reusable components, application states can be managed, while user interactions are dealt with effectively by software engineers. In addition, Yew has built-in support for state management within components and can work with external libraries dedicated to the same purpose. In this way large applications can implement complex state handling techniques through its API calls , hence supporting client-side routing which enables developers create single page websites with several views depending on what they want at any time hence creating modern websites that have smooth browsing experience.

### Example Code
Let us look at a simple example to illustrate how Yew can be used to build a basic counter application:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

struct Model {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    value: i32,
}

enum Msg {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}

impl Component for Model {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self { link, value: 0 }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Increment => self.value += 1,
            Msg::Decrement => self.value -= 1,
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::Increment)>{ "+1" }</button>
                <button onclick=self.link.callback(|_| Msg::Decrement)>{ "-1" }</button>
                <p>{ self.value }</p>
            </div>
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<Model>();
}
```
This piece of code represents a Yew application that counts. The link that holds the message to be sent and maintains the counter's value, is included in the primary parts of this program known as `Model struct`. The possible messages according to `Msg enum` are Increment and Decrement that work on the counter’s value. The Component trait is implemented for Model, which has methods for creating, updating messages, changing properties, and viewing. In the `view` method, there are buttons that increase or decrease the counter and one paragraph that shows its current value written in HTML format. The `main` function mounts a component of Model to the `DOM` at first to start off its execution.
