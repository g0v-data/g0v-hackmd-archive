### TICTeC 2024 Call for Proposals

We invite individuals to submit presentation abstracts or workshop proposals of no more than 300 words by 23.59 GMT 22nd March 2024.

We encourage presentation submissions to focus on the specific impacts of technologies, rather than showcase new tools that are as yet untested. Workshop proposals should be relevant to the conference theme - see more here.

Those selected for inclusion in the conference programme will be notified no later than 5th April 2024.

Presenters will be required to register for the conference by 19th April in order to confirm their slot (the registration fee will be waived for individuals presenting).

The conference, and therefore presentations/workshops, will happen on 12th and 13th June 2024 between 9am and 6pm British Summer Time, so proposers must be available on those dates/times. 

The data collected on this Google form will be used only by mySociety for event communications and logistics in accordance with our privacy policy. We will not share this data with anyone else unless you agree.


### If you'd like to do a presentation, please provide your presentation summary below (300 words maximum)

> Please ensure your summary details what real-world impacts your presentation will discuss. We will prioritise proposals that can demonstrate data or evidence of how civic tech has been impactful in some way. An abstract should include a brief overview of the research/work, the methods used, and the results you plan to share. Narratives or descriptions of tools or services will not be accepted. Please put N/A in the box below if you are proposing a workshop.


Answer: 

- vTaiwan 在 2023 年 6 月與英國智庫 Chatham House 共同投稿了 OpenAI 的 grant: democratic input to AI，我們將在這次簡報中分享來自 vTaiwan 社群的省思、分享專案成果、並提出 vTaiwan 的未來走向。

可能的分享大綱：
- What is Recursive Public
- Why we proposed Recursive Public? AI is a complex topic that requires a more complex deliberative process beyond Polis and vTaiwan. (that’s why the idea of “recursive” and ongoing deliberation was proposed)
- The Recursive Public framework 
- Reflections around the consultation meeting: (shoutout::: 這邊希望大家多協力！) 
    - The constitution of participants 
        - 邀請多方利害關係人的反思
    - More further discussion could be expanded 
        - 諮詢會議討論當下的反思
    - At the moment polling (emotion-gauging diameter)
        - 線上線下同步的狀況
    - Different Culture during the cooperation
        - 合作中觀察到的文化差異 [name=peter]
    - 其他
- Achievements 
    - share OpenAI's blog
        - It’s down to OpenAI in the end to decide how their AI would work. 
- Overall reflectino: The UK-Taiwan collaboration
