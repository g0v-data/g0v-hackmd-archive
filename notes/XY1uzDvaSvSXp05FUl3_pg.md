# Anyone using custom attribution for different clients in one system?
 The solution that finally worked for us was [ad tracking for agencies](https://www.redtrack.io/solutions/ad-agencies/). It let us assign custom attribution models per client—without having to run separate platforms or duplicate work. I could set one client to use 7-day click and another to use 1-day view, all inside the same system. It kept everything streamlined, and my team didn’t have to relearn workflows for each client. If you're managing multiple businesses with varied KPIs, this flexibility is essential.
