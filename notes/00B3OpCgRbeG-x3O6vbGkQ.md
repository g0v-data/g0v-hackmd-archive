Asthma is a chronic lung condition marked by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms can vary in intensity and are often triggered by allergens, cold air, physical activity, or respiratory infections. Asthma may have genetic roots, but environmental factors like pollution, allergens, and stress also contribute to its development. There are different forms of asthma, including allergic asthma, eosinophilic asthma (a severe type linked to high eosinophil levels), and cough variant asthma, where a persistent dry cough is the main symptom.

Treatment focuses on reducing inflammation and keeping airways open. Quick-relief medications such as Ventolin (albuterol/salbutamol) are fast-acting bronchodilators used during attacks or before exercise. Long-term control is managed with inhaled corticosteroids like Beclomethasone and Aristocort (triamcinolone), which reduce airway inflammation. Combination inhalers such as Seroflo, Advair Diskus, and Advair Rotacap combine corticosteroids with long-acting bronchodilators (LABAs) like salmeterol for ongoing symptom management. Theo-24 CR, an oral theophylline-based drug, offers extended bronchodilation but is used with caution due to potential side effects.

Asthma inhalers come in various forms, including metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and nebulizers. These devices ensure targeted delivery of medication to the lungs with fewer systemic effects. Proper inhaler technique is essential for effective treatment. An asthma action plan, developed with a healthcare provider, helps patients manage daily care and recognize warning signs of worsening symptoms or asthma attacks.

Other supportive treatments include Flixotide nasal spray, which relieves nasal congestion from allergic rhinitisâ€”often a coexisting condition in allergic asthma. Biologic therapies are used in severe asthma cases and target specific immune pathways such as IL-5 or IgE to control inflammation. Asthma in pets, such as cats, shares similar symptoms and treatments with human asthma. Managing allergies, using rescue inhalers as needed, and maintaining consistent use of controller medications are key strategies for effective long-term asthma control.
