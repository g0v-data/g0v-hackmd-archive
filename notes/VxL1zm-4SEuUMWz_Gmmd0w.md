## Discussions :)

## About the speaker...
I'm a software freelancer based in Tainan City, Taiwan. As a follower of open culture in internet, I used to focus on technical skills for working purpose. The 
[Sunflower Student Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_Student_Movement) changed my mind, or more exactly that the first kid did change my mind eairler. Information Technology becomes a tool. I kept my eyes on how to make Taiwan, the place I living, better using my skills. Maybe that's so called CivicTech. You could find more applications I made at [https://kiang.github.io/](https://kiang.github.io/). And I also talk about political topics through [fb fan page](https://www.facebook.com/k.olc.tw/).
