# Seamless Switchover: Utilizing a Blue-Green Deployment Strategy 
A key idea in contemporary software development and deployment methods, especially in the context of the [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/#:~:) paradigm, is [blue-green deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html#:~:). The difficulties of introducing updates and new features to web-based apps without upsetting users or causing downtime are addressed by this deployment model. Another name for this deployment process is "red-black" deployment. 

## Definition and Concept
Blue-green deployment, which means blue and green, is a concept that maintains two different but similar environments. They have the same hardware, software and configurations; they differ only in being opposite to each other. The application will be available for use in the blue environment while it will host updates and new features on the green one.

## Significance
The primary objective of blue-green deployment is to ensure continuous and smooth delivery of online apps’ bug fixes, functional improvements, as well as updates. By having two parallel environments – a live production environment (blue) and a staging area for changes (green), developers can modify the latter without interrupting activities on the former. This guarantees almost zero downtime when it comes to deploying new releases to users.

## Advantages of Blue-Green Deployment
Below are the advantages of blue-green deployment:

* Less Downtime: One of the key advantages of this type of deployment is that it minimizes downtime during updates. Deployments first go to the green environment such that any problem can be detected and fixed before moving user traffic from blue to green environment. This gives users the ability to receive uninterrupted service.


* Ability to Rollback: The blue-green strategy has an in-built mechanism for rolling back. If something does not work out after releasing an update on the green environment, it can quickly point back traffic towards the blue platform where things were stable in a previous version.

* Risk Mitigation: Effective risk management is possible through having two similar environments. In case there are unexpected problems with green, blue remains operational as a backup thus enabling continuity of services by the organization even during failure.

* Seamless Updates: With blue-green deployment, updates are seamless whereby traffic is gradually moved from the blue environment to the green one. This step-by-step transition makes it less painful for users and allows developers to monitor deployment in real-time.

## Testing in Production
Testing can be carried out in an environment that takes the form of a green environment. With this technique, the opportunity that users can be impacted by way of defects or overall performance issues is decreased by enabling developers to find and fasten issues early in the deployment process.

### Advantages of Testing in Production with Blue-Green Deployment
Using blue-green deployment for testing in production has numerous blessings.

It permits a developer to test adjustments in a sensible setting with a lot of traffic and record loads. With this, developers have to get admission to a practical environment. This technique makes a developer perceive issues early. Another aspect is that before updates are dispatched to the new environment, developers can perceive bugs, compatibility problems, or performance bottlenecks.

Testing in production additionally allows developers to generate a fast feedback loop via in-production testing, this makes it clean to iterate fast on actual external observations, resulting in faster issue resolution and extra effective improvement cycles.

Furthermore, it permits developers to pay attention to user-focused testing permitting them to ensure that changes satisfy consumer expectations and provide an unbroken experience.

The fact that it allows developers to examine modifications’ performance in green surroundings, makes a way of continuous development and encourages iterative upgrades and optimizations through the years.

### Best Practices for Testing in Production with Blue-Green Deployment
Following these steps is essential to a seamless blue-green deployment transition:

To avoid interfering with the live production environment, first, carry out isolated testing (blue). To prevent unforeseen effects on end users, keep testing in a green environment apart from production.

Secondly, implement a phased-in strategy. Before making larger adjustments, implement improvements in the green environment gradually and observe their impact. This regulated process reduces the possibility of widespread problems.

Thirdly, put strong observability and monitoring mechanisms into practice. These solutions enable early anomaly identification and prompt action by offering real-time insights into the behavior and performance of the application in a green environment.

Furthermore, prepare a backup plan. Make sure that a smooth process exists for rolling back modifications and returning to a reliable production environment if problems occur during testing.

Finally, use automated testing to make the testing procedure more efficient. Automated tests save manual labor and offer comprehensive coverage of test scenarios because they can be run fast and reliably.

Example Scenario:
Consider a social media platform introducing a new messaging feature. With blue-green deployment, the development team can test the new feature in a green environment, simulating real user interactions and message exchanges. They monitor the performance of the feature, including message delivery times, user interface responsiveness, and server resource utilization. If any issues are identified, they can quickly iterate on the changes and retest until the feature meets quality standards. Once validated, the feature is seamlessly rolled out to the live production environment, providing users with a smooth and reliable messaging experience.

## Use Cases
Blue-green deployment is commonly used in various scenarios, including:
  
* Web Applications: For rolling out updates, new features, or bug fixes to web-based applications without downtime. Examples of web applications that utilize this deployment strategy include [LinkedIn](https://ng.linkedin.com/) and [Github](https://github.com).
  
* E-commerce Platforms: To ensure continuous availability of online stores and minimize disruptions during updates or maintenance. Examples of e-commerce platforms that utilize this deployment strategy include [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com).
  
* SaaS (Software as a Service) Platforms: For deploying updates to cloud-based applications while maintaining service availability for users. Platforms such as [SalesForce](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce) and [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) utilize this strategy. 

## How does deployment work?
Blue-green deployment operates on the principle of maintaining two identical yet separate environments, allowing for seamless updates and minimal downtime during the deployment process. Below is a detailed explanation of how blue-green deployment works, along with examples where necessary:

### Working Principles
We'll use the image below to illustrate the working principles of blue-green deployment.

Source: aws.amazon.com

In this deployment model, two environments are utilized: blue and green. Let's illustrate this with an example. Assume that version 1 is the current version of the application, while version 1.1 represents the new update. Version 1 is designated as the blue environment, while Version 1.1 is the green environment.

### The Process of Switching Traffic Between Environments
As seen in the above image, [load balancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)) are used to move users from the blue instance to the green one. Load balancers provide instantaneous switching in contrast to [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) record changes, which may take some time to propagate. The load balancer directs fresh traffic to the green environment by using the same DNS record, enabling smooth user control. If there are problems with the green instance, this is essential for rapidly rolling users back to version 1 (the blue instance).

### Deployment and parallel running
The green instance (version 1.1) runs concurrently with the older version in production after it is judged ready. Traffic is seamlessly diverted from the blue instance to the green instance via the load balancer. As they effortlessly access the updated version of the service or program, the majority of users won't even notice the move.

### Monitoring
Once traffic is routed to the green instance, [smoke tests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)) are carried out by DevOps engineers to make sure the updated version is operating as intended. They can find any problems with the new version before they have a significant impact on a large number of users, thanks to this crucial stage. It makes sure that everything is functioning as it should in the latest version.

## Deployment Process
In this section, we'll dissect the various steps used in the deployment process. Blue-green deployment follows a series of steps to roll out updates and changes smoothly:

### Step 1: Duplicating Resources
The first step involves duplicating all resources used by the application in both the blue and green environments. This includes duplicating databases, server configurations, and any other components of the application infrastructure.
   
For example:  
The organization ensures that both the blue and green environments have identical copies of the database, ensuring that data consistency is maintained across both environments.

### Step 2: Updating the Server
Once the resources are duplicated, the next step is to update the green environment with new features, updates, or bug fixes. This involves deploying the changes to the green environment and testing them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
   
For example:  
The development team deploys a new version of the website with updated features, such as a redesigned checkout process, in a green environment. They then conduct extensive testing to verify that the new features function correctly and do not introduce any issues.

### Step 3: Switching Traffic to the New Server
After the updates have been deployed and tested in the green environment, traffic is gradually switched from the blue environment to the green environment. This is typically done using a routing device, such as a load balancer, that redirects incoming traffic to the green environment.
   
For example: 
The organization configures the load balancer to start directing a small percentage of traffic to the green environment while monitoring performance. If everything goes smoothly, more traffic will gradually shift to the green environment until all traffic is routed there.

### Step 4: Relegating the Old Platform
Once all traffic has been successfully redirected to the green environment, the blue environment becomes inactive and is relegated to a backup or standby role. It is kept in this state in case a rollback is needed or as a reference for future updates.
   
For example:  
With all users now accessing the green environment, the blue environment is no longer serving traffic. It is maintained as a backup, allowing the organization to quickly switch back to it if any issues arise with the green environment.

## Continuous Cycle
Blue-green deployment is a never-ending cycle that alternates between the two environments—blue and green—in active and dormant roles regularly. This cycle makes sure that updating procedures are smooth and effective while causing the least amount of inconvenience to users. Here's the procedure for the continuous cycle:

### Regular Updates 
Blue-green deployment encourages frequent updates to the application or service. This could include bug fixes, feature enhancements, security patches, or performance optimizations. The development team continuously works on improving the application, iterating on feedback, and implementing new features to meet evolving user needs.

### Alternating Environments
At any given time, one environment is active (serving production traffic) while the other is inactive (ready for updates or rollback). Initially, the blue environment is active, serving the current version of the application to users. Meanwhile, the green environment remains inactive, allowing for updates, testing, and preparation for the next release.

### Rolling Out Updates
When a new update is ready for deployment, it is implemented in the inactive green environment. The green environment undergoes thorough testing, including functional testing, integration testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the update meets quality standards. Once testing is successful and the green environment is verified as stable, traffic is gradually shifted from the blue to the green environment.

### Transitioning Traffic
Traffic redirection is typically managed through load balancers or routing rules. Initially, only a small portion of traffic is routed to the green environment to minimize risk and allow for monitoring of performance and user experience. As confidence in the new version grows, more traffic is directed to the green environment until it becomes the primary production environment.

### Active and inactive roles
After traffic is successfully transitioned to the green environment, it becomes the new active environment. Meanwhile, the blue environment, which previously served as the active environment, is now inactive. The inactive environment serves as a backup or rollback option in case issues arise with the new version. The roles of the environments are then swapped, with the inactive becoming active and vice versa, ready for the next update cycle.

### Continuous monitoring and improvement
Throughout the deployment cycle, continuous monitoring of both environments is essential to ensure performance, stability, and user experience.

Any issues or anomalies detected in either environment are addressed promptly to maintain service quality. Feedback from users and stakeholders is collected and used to inform future updates and improvements, thus perpetuating the cycle of continuous enhancement.

Overall, the continuous cycle of blue-green deployment enables organizations to achieve rapid, reliable, and efficient updates to their applications or services while ensuring minimal disruption to users. By maintaining two identical environments and alternating between them, blue-green deployment provides a robust framework for deploying updates safely and efficiently.

### Benefits of the Continuous Cycle Approach to Organizations 
Using this strategy, organizations can:

Reduce downtime by alternating traffic across environments gradually, making sure that consumers have little to no disruptions when updating.

To minimize the risk of service disruptions, reduce risk by permitting a quick rollback to the prior version (blue environment) if there are problems with the new version (green environment).

Test thoroughly in a green environment before transferring traffic to ensure that upgrades fulfill quality requirements and function as intended.

Maintain application continuity by keeping it updated to reflect changing market trends and requirements.

Boost deployment process resilience by providing an inactive environment that is prepared to take over in the event of a failure.

Facilitate quick iteration by streamlining the deployment process. This will let firms update more quickly and react to customer input and market demands.

For example:  
After the green environment becomes the new live version, the development team starts preparing the next update in the now-inactive blue environment. This cycle continues, with updates being deployed to the green environment, tested, and then switched over to become the new live version.

## Other types of deployment strategies
In software development and deployment, various strategies are used to manage updates, releases, and maintenance of applications. Let's explore the different types of deployment and provide examples where necessary:

### Canary Deployment
Canary deployment involves rolling out updates to a small subset of users before making them available to the entire user base. This allows for early feedback and the detection of issues before widespread deployment.
  
For example:
A social media platform adopts canary deployment to test a new feature. Initially, the feature is made available to a small group of users, such as beta testers or internal employees. If the feature receives positive feedback and shows no issues, it is gradually rolled out to a larger audience. This approach helps mitigate risks by identifying and addressing issues early in the deployment process.

### Rolling Deployment
Rolling deployment involves gradually updating servers or components of an application, typically one at a time or in small batches. This allows for updates to be rolled out without disrupting the entire system at once.
  
For example:
A cloud-based email service implements rolling deployments to update its servers. Instead of updating all servers simultaneously, updates are rolled out to a few servers at a time. This ensures that users continue to have access to the service while updates are being applied. If any issues arise, only a subset of users are affected, minimizing the impact.

### Recreate Deployment or Basic Deployment
Recreate deployment, sometimes referred to as basic deployment, entails bringing the application back online after it has been updated and completely offline. When compared to alternative deployment tactics, this method is less flexible and may cause downtime.
  
For example: 
A small business website undergoes a re-deployment to update its content management system [(CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system). The website is taken offline, the CMS is updated, and then the website is brought back online. During this process, users are unable to access the website, resulting in downtime. While this approach may be suitable for smaller organizations with minimal traffic, it is not ideal for high-traffic or critical applications.

### Multi-Service Deployment
Updating various parts or services of an application concurrently but separately is known as multi-service deployment. This makes it possible to roll out upgrades without having an impact on the overall program.
  
For example:
An online banking application adopts multi-service deployment to update its various services, such as account management, payments, and transactions. Each service can be updated independently, allowing the application to remain operational while updates are applied. This approach helps minimize disruptions and ensures that users can continue to access the application without interruption.

## Advantages of blue-green deployment over other deployment strategies  
Compared to alternative deployment methodologies, blue-green deployment has the following advantages:

One of its main advantages is maintaining zero downtime. Traffic may switch between two identical environments (blue and green) with ease, guaranteeing uninterrupted service while upgrades are being made.

Rollback capability is easy to use and instantaneous. If problems do occur, quickly reverting the router to its prior configuration (blue to green or vice versa) will ensure the least amount of disturbance.

With this deployment technique, new features and upgrades can be quickly and carefully sent out and rolled back, guaranteeing that any problematic versions may be turned back without affecting users.

Production testing is made easier because new versions can be tested with actual user traffic in an inactive environment (like green) without interfering with the live environment (blue).

Support for scalability makes it simple to add more instances of the inactive environment to accommodate growing loads without affecting the active environment.

By operating two similar environments and identifying and resolving problems before transitioning to live traffic, blue-green deployment minimizes risk and downtime.

Many organizations use this strategy because it offers a dependable and strong way to implement changes to production with the least amount of risk and disruption.

## Benefits of Blue-Green Deployment
This deployment strategy has many benefits, making it a unique type of deployment option. The following are the benefits of blue-green deployment:

### Maintains a standby system
A fully functional system (blue) is always available to act as a backup, thanks to this deployment strategy. If the active system experiences unanticipated problems or malfunctions, this backup system offers a safety net (green).
   
For example:
A banking application employs blue-green deployment to ensure the continuous availability of its services. The blue environment serves as the standby system, ready to take over if the green environment experiences any technical issues. This ensures that customers can access their accounts and conduct transactions without interruption.

### Returns to Former Iterations Right Away
If there are problems with the new deployment, a swift rollback to an earlier version is possible using a blue-green deployment. This feature guarantees that problems may be resolved quickly, reducing the effect on users.
   
For example:
A video streaming platform rolls out a new feature using this deployment strategy. However, users encounter playback issues with the new feature. The development team quickly rolls back to the previous version (blue), restoring normal playback functionality for users.

### Enables Deployment Without Downtime
This deployment gradually transitions traffic from the old version to the new version, thereby eliminating downtime during upgrades or deployments. This guarantees that users won't see any interruptions when using the application.
   
For example:
An e-commerce website updates its product catalog using blue-green deployment. Traffic is gradually redirected from the old catalog (blue) to the updated catalog (green) without any downtime. Customers can continue browsing and purchasing products seamlessly during the update process.

### Ensures smooth and autonomous upgrades
Blue-green deployment transfers traffic from the old environment to the new environment gradually, enabling automated and seamless updates. This makes sure that during the deployment process, users are not disturbed.
   
For example:
A software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform updates its user interface using blue-green deployment. The new interface is deployed in a green environment and gradually rolled out to users. Users seamlessly transition to the new interface without experiencing any downtime or disruptions.

### Test in Production
The deployment allows you to test updates or new features in a production-like setting (green) without affecting end users. By doing this, it is ensured that any problems are found and fixed before being deployed to the live environment.
   
For example:
A social media platform introduces a new messaging feature using blue-green deployment. The feature is tested in a green environment, allowing the development team to identify and fix any bugs or usability issues before making it available to all users.

## Challenges of Blue-Green Deployment
Utilizing this deployment strategy also comes with difficulties and challenges. Let's take a look at the challenges of blue-green deployment.

### Costs
It can be expensive to set up and maintain two similar environments in terms of resources, infrastructure, and overhead. This can be a major obstacle for businesses with tight expenditures.
   
For example:
A startup company may find it challenging to afford the infrastructure required for blue-green deployment. They may opt for simpler deployment strategies initially to minimize costs.

### Difficulty in Scaling
Maintaining two similar environments and guaranteeing scalability can become more difficult and resource-intensive as the program and user base expand.
   
For example:
A rapidly growing online marketplace struggles to scale its blue-green deployment infrastructure to handle the increasing number of users and transactions. They may need to invest in additional resources and technologies to support scalability.

### Difficulty in Database Management
Managing databases in a blue-green deployment configuration can be difficult and may call for careful planning and collaboration, particularly when upgrades entail schema modifications.
   
For example:
An enterprise resource planning [(ERP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) system updates its database structure using blue-green deployment. The development team must ensure that both environments remain synchronized and that data integrity is maintained during the update process.

### Distorted user transactions
User transactions might be lost or halted during the switch from the old to the new environment, which could result in a bad user experience.
   
For example:
An online banking application switches from the old environment (blue) to the new environment (green) using blue-green deployment. Some users may experience transaction failures or delays during the transition, requiring them to retry transactions.

## Conclusion
Blue-green deployment is a useful method for handling upgrades and releases in today's hectic software development environment, all while preserving service availability and reducing interruptions. Organizations can create dependable, effective, and resilient software delivery processes by tactically applying deployment techniques and carefully assessing the advantages and disadvantages.
