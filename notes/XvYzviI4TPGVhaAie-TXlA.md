When it comes to vehicle safety, the braking system plays a significant role. Ensuring that your brake pads and brake discs are functioning optimally is crucial for your safety and the safety of others on the road. This comprehensive guide will provide you with all the information you  need to know about brake pads replacement and brake discs change, as well as the importance of regular maintenance.

1. **Braking System Basics**

Both disc and drum brakes operate on a hydraulic pressure system. The braking process begins with a mechanical force, which is your foot pressing the brake pedal. This force is then transformed into hydraulic pressure through various components, ultimately resulting in your vehicle coming to a stop. The five primary components of a braking system are the master cylinder, brake fluid, brake lines and hoses, disc brake assembly, and drum brake assembly. These components work together to create friction, which converts kinetic energy into heat and stops your vehicle.

2. **Understanding Disc Brakes**

Disc brakes are commonly found on most modern vehicles and are mounted on the front and/or rear axle. The primary components of a disc brake system include the brake caliper, brake pads, and brake rotor. When you apply the brakes, the caliper squeezes the brake pads against the rotor, creating friction and slowing down the wheel.

2.1 **Brake Calipers**

Brake calipers are assemblies mounted to the vehicle with a bracket, framing the rotor and functioning like a c-clamp. They contain brake pads, one or multiple pistons, a bleeder screw, a rubber piston seal, a dust boot, and anti-rattle clips.

2.2 **Brake Rotors**

The brake rotor is made of cast iron or a steel/cast iron composite and is attached to the wheel hub. When the brake pads press against both sides of the rotor, friction is created to stop the wheel's rotation.

3. **Understanding Drum Brakes**

Drum brakes are typically used on the rear axle of some vehicles and are common on trailers. Instead of brake pads, drum brakes use a wheel cylinder with pistons that push brake shoes against the inside of a spinning drum. When this contact occurs, the rotation of the brake drum and wheel slows, stopping your vehicle.

4. **Disc vs. Drum Brakes**

Many of today's vehicles have disc brakes on all four wheels, while some still have disc brakes on the front axle and drum brakes on the rear. Disc brakes are generally more effective for stopping due to the weight distribution in most vehicles. The front of a vehicle is typically heavier, requiring more braking power, which is provided by disc brakes.
