# Seamless Switchover: Utilizing a Blue-Green Deployment Strategy 
A key idea in contemporary software development and deployment methods, especially in the context of the [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/#:~:) paradigm, is [blue-green deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html#:~:). The difficulties of introducing updates and new features to web-based apps without upsetting users or causing downtime are addressed by this deployment model. Another name for this deployment process is "red-black" deployment. 

## Definition and Concept
Blue-green deployment, which means blue and green, is a concept that maintains two different but similar environments. They have the same hardware, software and configurations; they differ only in being opposite to each other. The application will be available for use in the blue environment while it will host updates and new features on the green one.

## Significance
The primary objective of blue-green deployment is to ensure continuous and smooth delivery of online apps’ bug fixes, functional improvements, as well as updates. By having two parallel environments – a live production environment (blue) and a staging area for changes (green), developers can modify the latter without interrupting activities on the former. This guarantees almost zero downtime when it comes to deploying new releases to users.

## Advantages of Blue-Green Deployment
Below are the advantages of blue-green deployment:

* Less Downtime: One of the key advantages of this type of deployment is that it minimizes downtime during updates. Deployments first go to the green environment such that any problem can be detected and fixed before moving user traffic from blue to green environment. This gives users the ability to receive uninterrupted service.


* Ability to Rollback: The blue-green strategy has an in-built mechanism for rolling back. If something does not work out after releasing an update on the green environment, it can quickly point back traffic towards the blue platform where things were stable in a previous version.

* Risk Mitigation: Effective risk management is possible through having two similar environments. In case there are unexpected problems with green, blue remains operational as a backup thus enabling continuity of services by the organization even during failure.

* Seamless Updates: With blue-green deployment, updates are seamless whereby traffic is gradually moved from the blue environment to the green one. This step-by-step transition makes it less painful for users and allows developers to monitor deployment in real-time.

## Testing in Production
Testing can be carried out in an environment that takes the form of a green environment. With this technique, the opportunity that users can be impacted by way of defects or overall performance issues is decreased by enabling developers to find and fasten issues early in the deployment process.

### Advantages of Testing in Production with Blue-Green Deployment
Using blue-green deployment for testing in production has numerous blessings.

It permits a developer to test adjustments in a sensible setting with a lot of traffic and record loads. With this, developers have to get admission to a practical environment. This technique makes a developer perceive issues early. Another aspect is that before updates are dispatched to the new environment, developers can perceive bugs, compatibility problems, or performance bottlenecks.

Testing in production additionally allows developers to generate a fast feedback loop via in-production testing, this makes it clean to iterate fast on actual external observations, resulting in faster issue resolution and extra effective improvement cycles.

Furthermore, it permits developers to pay attention to user-focused testing permitting them to ensure that changes satisfy consumer expectations and provide an unbroken experience.

The fact that it allows developers to examine modifications’ performance in green surroundings, makes a way of continuous development and encourages iterative upgrades and optimizations through the years.

### Best Practices for Testing in Production with Blue-Green Deployment
The steps we are going to discuss below are vital to an unbroken blue-green deployment transition:

To keep away from interfering with the live production environment, first, carry out remoted trying out (blue). To save you unexpected consequences of giving up users, preserve testing in a green environment other than just production.

Secondly, put into effect a phased-in strategy. Before making larger changes, enforce upgrades in the green surroundings gradually and have a look at their impact. This regulated technique reduces the opportunity for good-sized troubles.

Thirdly, put strong observability and monitoring mechanisms into exercise. These answers permit early anomaly identification and activate swift actions by providing actual-time insights into the conduct and performance of the application in a green environment.

Furthermore, prepare a backup plan. Make certain that a smooth manner exists for rolling back adjustments and returning to dependable production surroundings if issues occur at some point of testing.

Finally, use automated trying out to make the checking out process more efficient. Automated checks keep manual hard work and provide comprehensive coverage of test situations because they can be fast and reliable.

Example Scenario:
Let's consider a social media platform introducing a new messaging feature. With blue-green deployment, the improvement crew can test the new function in a green environment, simulating actual consumer interactions and message exchanges. They reveal the performance of the characteristics, including message shipping times, consumer interface responsiveness, and server aid utilization. If any concerns are recognized, they could quickly repeat the modifications in a set and retest until the function meets great requirements. Once it is in place, the feature is smoothly rolled out to the live manufacturing surroundings, presenting users with a smooth and dependable messaging experience. 

## Use Cases
Blue-green deployment is normally used in diverse eventualities, which include:

* Web Applications: For rolling out updates, new functions, or worm fixes to internet-primarily based applications without downtime. Examples of internet packages that make use of this deployment method encompass LinkedIn and Github.

* E-commerce Platforms:  The blue-green deployment method is used to deploy updates to applications that are cloud-based and limit disruptions all through updates or upkeep. Examples of e-trade platforms that make use of  this deployment approach encompass Amazon and Etsy.

* SaaS (Software as a Service) Platforms: For deploying updates to cloud-based totally applications at the same time as preserving provider availability for users. Platforms which include SalesForce and Google Workspace utilize this approach.

## How does deployment work?
Blue-green deployment operates on the principle of preserving identical yet separate environments, taking into account seamless updates and minimal downtime for the duration of the deployment technique. Below is a detailed clarification of how blue-green deployment works, in conjunction with examples.

### Working Principles
We'll use the image below to illustrate the working principles of blue-green deployment.

Source: aws.amazon.com

We use two deployment models in this method: blue and green. Let’s illustrate this with an example. Assume that version 1 is the current version of the application, while version 1.1 represents the new update. Version 1 is used as the blue environment, while Version 1.1 is the green environment.

### The Process of Switching Traffic Between Environments
As seen in the above image, load balancers are used to move users from the blue instance to the green one. Load balancers provide instantaneous switching in contrast to DNS record changes, which may take some time to propagate. The load balancer is used to direct fresh traffic to the green environment by using the same DNS record which will definitely enable smooth user control. In a situation where there are problems with the green instance, this is essential for rapidly rolling users back to version 1 (the blue instance).

### Deployment and parallel running
The green environment (version 1.1) runs simultaneously with the older version in production after it's miles judged ready. Traffic is seamlessly diverted from the blue instance to the green instance through the burden balancer. As they effect get admission to the updated version of the carrier or program, the bulk of users won’t even notice the move.

### Monitoring
Once visitors are routed to the green instance, smoke tests are accomplished through DevOps engineers to make sure the updated model is working as expected. They can find any issues with the new version before they have an enormous impact on a large number of users, thanks to this critical degree.

## Deployment Process
In this section, we are going to look at the numerous steps used in the deployment method. Blue-green deployment follows a sequence of steps to roll out updates and changes smoothly:

### Step 1: Duplicating Resources
The first step involves duplicating all sources used by the utility in both the blue and green environments. This consists of duplicating databases, server configurations, and some other additives of the software infrastructure.

For instance:
The employer guarantees that both the blue and green environments have equal copies of the database, ensuring that information consistency is maintained across each environment.

### Step 2: Updating the Server
The moment the resources are duplicated, the next step is to update the green environment with new features, updates, or worm fixes. This involves deploying the modifications to the green environment and checking them out thoroughly to make sure they work as planned.

For instance:
The improvement crew deploys a new edition of the internet site with updated features, inclusive of a redesigned checkout procedure, in a green environment. They then conduct significant checks to verify that the new functions are characterized correctly and do not introduce any troubles.

### Step 3: Switching Traffic to the New Server
After the updates were deployed and tested in the green surroundings, users gradually switched from the blue environment to the green surroundings. This is commonly completed the use of a routing tool, which includes a load balancer, that redirects incoming visitors to the green environment.

For instance:
The company configures the burden balancer to begin directing a small percentage of traffic to the green environment at the same time as monitoring overall performance. If the whole thing is going easily, extra visitors will regularly shift to the green environment until all site visitors is routed there.

### Step four: Relegating the Old Platform
Once all traffic has been correctly redirected to the green environment, the blue surroundings will become inactive and relegated to a backup or standby function. It is saved in this state in case a rollback is needed or as a reference for destiny updates.

For instance:
With all users now accessing the green environment, the blue surroundings are not serving visitors. It is maintained as a backup, allowing the employer to quick switch back to it if any problems arise with the green environment.

## Continuous Cycle
Blue-green deployment is a never-finishing cycle that alternates between the two environments—blue and green—in lively and dormant roles regularly. This cycle makes certain that updating processes are smooth and effective whilst inflicting the least amount of inconvenience to users. Here’s the process for the continuous cycle:

### Regular Updates
Blue-green deployment encourages common updates to the software or carrier. This should include worm fixes, feature improvements, safety patches, or performance optimizations. The development crew constantly works on improving the utility, iterating on remarks, and implementing new functions to fulfill evolving consumer wishes.

### Alternating Environments
At any given time, one environment is energetic (serving manufacturing visitors) whilst the opposite is inactive (ready for updates or rollback). Initially, blue environments are energetic, serving the present-day version of the application to customers. Meanwhile, the green environment stays inactive, making an allowance for updates, trying out, and training for the next launch.

### Rolling Out Updates
When a brand new replacement is ready for deployment, it's miles implemented inside the inactive green environment. The green environment undergoes thorough checking out, inclusive of practical trying out, integration checking out, performance testing and person attractiveness checking out, to ensure the replacement meets excellent standards. Once testing is a hit and the inexperienced surroundings are validated as stable, site visitors are progressively shifted from the blue to the green environment.

### Transitioning Traffic
Traffic redirection is normally controlled through load balancers or routing rules. Initially, a small portion of traffic is routed to the green environment to minimize hazards and permit for tracking of performance and user revel in. As confidence in the new edition grows, more site visitors is directed to the green environment till it turns into the primary production environment.

### Active and inactive roles
After site visitors is effectively transitioned to the inexperienced environment, it turns into a new energetic environment. Meanwhile, the blue surroundings, which previously served as the active environment, are now inactive. The inactive environment serves as a backup or rollback option in case problems arise with the new edition. The roles of the environments are then swapped, with the inactive turning into energetic and vice versa, equipped for the next replacement cycle.

### Continuous tracking and improvement
Throughout the deployment cycle, non-stop monitoring of both environments is important to make sure overall performance, stability, and consumer experience.

Any issues or anomalies detected in either environments are addressed right away to keep the provider excellent. Feedback from customers and stakeholders is accumulated and used to tell future updates and improvements, for that reason perpetuating the cycle of non-stop enhancement.

Overall, the non-stop cycle of blue-green deployment enables businesses to acquire fast, reliable, and efficient updates to their applications or offerings while ensuring minimal disruption to customers. By maintaining equal environments and alternating among them, blue-green deployment gives a robust framework for deploying updates effectively and effectively.


## Benefits of Blue-Green Deployment
This deployment strategy has many benefits, making it a unique type of deployment option. Let us take a look at the benefits of blue-green deployment:

### Maintains a standby system
A fully useful device (blue) is usually available to behave as a backup, way to this deployment strategy. If the lively system studies unanticipated problems or malfunctions, this backup system gives a safe internet (green).

For example:
A banking software employs blue-green deployment to make sure the non-stop availability of its services. The blue surroundings serves because the standby gadget, equipped to take over if the green environment stories any technical troubles. This ensures that customers can access their bills and behavior transactions without interruption.

### Returns to Former Iterations Right Away
If there are problems with the brand-new deployment, a swift rollback to an earlier model is possible the use of a blue-green deployment. This feature guarantees that troubles can be resolved quickly, lowering the impact on customers.

For instance:
A video streaming platform rolls out a new characteristic the usage of this deployment approach. However, customers come across playback troubles with the brand-new feature. The development crew quickly rolls back to the previous model (blue), restoring regular playback functionality for customers.

### Enables Deployment Without Downtime
This deployment regularly transitions site visitors from the antique version to the new edition, thereby putting off downtime in the course of enhancements or deployments. This ensures that users don’t see any interruptions while the use of the utility.

For example:
An e-commerce website updates its product catalog with the use of blue-green deployment. Traffic is step-by-step redirected from the vintage catalog (blue) to the up-to-date catalog (green) without any downtime. Customers can keep browsing and shopping merchandise seamlessly in the course of the update method.

### Ensures easy and autonomous enhancements
Blue-green deployment transfers traffic from the vintage surroundings to the brand-new environment gradually, permitting automated and seamless updates. This makes certain that in the deployment method, users are not disturbed.

For example:
A software-as-a-provider (SaaS) platform updates its consumer interface the use of blue-green deployment. The new interface is deployed in green surroundings and steadily rolled out to customers. Users seamlessly transition to the brand-new interface without experiencing any downtime or disruptions.

### Test in Production
The deployment lets in you to check updates or new capabilities in a production-like setting (green) without affecting end users. By doing this, it is ensured that any issues are discovered and stuck earlier than being deployed to the live environment.

For instance:
A social media platform introduces a brand new messaging function the use of blue-green deployment. The feature is examined in green surroundings, allowing the improvement group to become aware of and connect any insects or usability troubles before making it available to all customers.

## Challenges of Blue-Green Deployment
Maintains a standby system
A fully useful device (blue) is usually available to behave as a backup, way to this deployment strategy. If the lively system studies unanticipated problems or malfunctions, this backup system gives a safe internet (green). Utilizing this deployment approach also comes with problems and demanding situations. Let’s take a look at the demanding situations of blue-green deployment.

### Costs
It can be steeply priced to install and preserve comparable environments in terms of assets, infrastructure, and overhead. This may be a main impediment for groups with tight expenditures.

For example:
A startup company may additionally locate it hard to find the money for the infrastructure required for blue-inexperienced deployment. They may also choose less complicated deployment techniques to start with to limit prices.

### Difficulty in Scaling
Maintaining comparable environments and making sure scalability can turn out to be extra difficult and useful resource-intensive as the program and user base amplify.

For instance:
A rapidly growing online marketplace struggles to scale its blue-green deployment infrastructure to deal with the growing wide variety of customers and transactions. They may need to put money into additional resources and technologies to aid scalability.

Difficulty in Database Management
Managing databases in a blue-green deployment configuration may be hard and may call for careful making of plans and collaboration, especially whilst improvements entail schema adjustments.

For instance:
An employer's useful resource-making plans (ERP) system updates its database structure using blue-green deployment. The improvement team should make sure that both environments remain synchronized and that record integrity is maintained for the duration of the replacement.

### Distorted user transactions
User transactions might be misplaced or halted at some stage in the transfer from the antique to the new surroundings, which could bring about a horrific personal experience.

For instance:
An online banking application switches from the old environment (blue) to the new environment (green) the usage of blue-green deployment. Some customers may revel in transaction failures or delays for the duration of the transition, requiring them to retry transactions.
For example:
A banking software employs blue-green deployment to make sure the non-stop availability of its services. The blue surroundings serves because the standby gadget, equipped to take over if the green environment stories any technical troubles. This ensures that customers can access their bills and behavior transactions without interruption.
