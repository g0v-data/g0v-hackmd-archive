# Concerns about g0v Summit 2020 Call for Proposals

## Concern 1:

While filling in the proposal form it was not clear to me if it is possible to use CC-by-sa licenced material for the presentation slides and the talk, since there is only the option to share with CC-by. Also it was confusing because if you tick "No" for the CC-by licence of the proposal abstrct (first question of the form) the platform does not allow to proceed with the "submitt proposal" button is clicked at the end of the form.

## Concern 2:

It is compulsory to login with only 4 alternatives: Google, Slack, GitHub and Facebook. This is terrible for hacktivists in general since they are forced make use of Big USA corporate identity management systems in order to participate in G0V summit. Just imagine that somebody organizes a summit for world activists and entrepreneurs and everybody is forced to identify themselves exclusively with Wechat, Tiktok, or Tencent.
