Last month, I nearly authorized a payment for an invoice that looked completely legitimate. The vendor name was close to one we work with, the formatting was spot-on, and the amount was reasonable. What triggered suspicion was a slight variation in the email address and a rush in the message tone. That made me pause and dig deeper. While searching for clear info on this type of fraud, I came across a detailed article [here](https://precoro.com/blog/what-is-invoice-fraud/). It broke down common tactics used by scammers—like switching out bank details last minute or cloning legitimate invoices—and explained how to verify everything without slowing down the whole process.
