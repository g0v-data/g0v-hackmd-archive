## Call for Speakers [ended]

### Intro

18 undergraduate students from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) based in Boston are coming to Taiwan as part of a summer program, called the [“Dialogue of Civilizations”](https://goglobal.northeastern.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&id=10457). They asked if g0v community participants would be interested in hosting an event to introduce the community to these students to help them understand Taiwan’s civic tech activism, g0v's representative projects, and their role in Taiwan’s democracy.

### Request

They have asked for two speakers to present and attend a Q&A.
