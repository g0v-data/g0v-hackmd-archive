 Racquet War was first started in 2009 by Oakley Foy and Robin Barringer. The first destination tournaments were held once a year at the Saddlebrook Resort, just outside of Tampa, FL. Over the next couple of years, Racquet War tried many different formats, including NTRP division, age divisions, World Team Tennis, and even prize money events, in all different cities like Houston and Atlanta. Everything was “kind of” successful already, but they took off when Oakley developed the Waterfall Bracket format which is still in use today. It was developed with the players in mind, allowing anyone to play with anyone; their NTRP’s didn’t matter anymore. Visit here https://racquetwar.com
