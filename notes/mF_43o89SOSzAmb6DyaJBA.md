Manual for Cofacts LINE bot collaboration / Bug Report Group
===

:::info
The Basic Principle
The Facebook group is not a place for requesting a hoax-bust. We anticipate the Facebook group is a place for maintaining the functionality of the system and to communicate urgent information or to report a bug. We appreciate you for reporting an issue when using the system or create a post about your issue with verifying and responding. We will look into them and reply ASAP.
If you have a possible hoax request you need to submit, we recommend you to leave that to our LINE bot, if the bot doesn’t respond to your request, it means our editors are still working hard trying to help verifying the source. Please wait patiently, we sincerely hope you also can join us.

:::

We listed some examples below that are irrelevant to our Facebook group, turn off commenting if necessary. Leave the page simply for relevant discussion only.

## Posting a hoax-busting request

E.g. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1847232902175197/permalink/1895220730709747/

A proper comment example:

```
Hello friend,

This Facebook group is for posting about any question or difficulty encountered when trying to respond to hoax-bust requests. We tend to keep this page in that category only. Please post about relevant information. If you have any difficulty with a hoax-bust request, please write its following information:

(a) Its link on cofacts.g0v.tw (Required field)
(b) Relevant information you find. (Required field)
(c) The difficulty you have or any question about responding to that request.
(d) A draft of your response or idea. (Please try your best)


To make more room for relevant posts, if all four fields listed above is not filled in, our moderators will turn commenting of that post off in one day. We are sorry and we thank you for your consideration.

```

After receiving feedback or information about the post, please ask a moderator to organize them and make them into a response to that request.

e.g. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1847232902175197/permalink/1895182344046919/


If the answer is pretty obvious, then why not respond to that request right now?
