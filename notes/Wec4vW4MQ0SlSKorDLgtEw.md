Notes from Sep 13/14 2025

1. Certification of hardware (JP)
Japanese law requires new models of devices that transmit radio frequency need to be certified by government standards
Can only apply be organizations and take long time
    - Ways to work around

        1. Use certificated module
        2. Temporary exemption for experiments using un certified devices for 180 days, but still difficult.
Please refer the flow-chart, it depends on which device you use.

    This can be a problem for open hardware projects, simple bluetooth device (DIY Keyboards, etc) or building mesh networks. 

* relevant regulation: 技術基準適合認定

* competent authority: 総務省(Ministry of Internal     Affairs and Communications)

* Similar rules in other countries?
similar rules exist in Korea - if one tweaked bluetooth keyboards, the keyboards can be for personal use but not allowed to sell them. 

* But difference in the rationale for the regulation? 
    KR - local makers' intention to have stronger control of the market
    JP - focus on regulation airwave
    
    
    
2. Digital government (procurement for cloud services) 
   Initiative for all governments  including local governments to store important data in government cloud. 
   Digital Agency has negotiated collective contracts for cloud services provieders such as AWS, MS, Google and Oracle. 
   But local governments need to sign another contract, it makes them difficult to find out how much other local governments paid.Some kind of Collective Procurement Project may help. 
   
   Japanese government also has a certification system for secure cloud services called "ISMAP".
   If the cloud services are registerd for the certification, governments can procure the services more easily.
   However, it costs a lot for cloud vendors to acquire this certification because it requires third party assurance by consulting firms. It makes start-ups difficult to acquire this certification.

3. Privacy compliance for websites 
In Korea, to start a website in Korean, there are many guidelines to follow. To make things easier for small operators, PIPC in Korea provide a template (Note: still read carefully before adopting) 

* privacy.gov.kr/front.main/main.do
 
  Japan has Act on the Protection of Personal Information and Committee for the protection of Personal Information, which creates the guidlines for the use of personal information

4. Other issues
   Discussed about social media ban in Australia for minors and age verifications laws in some US states and European countries. 
   Concerns raised about actual implementation problems and privacy issues (e.g. forcing users to turn on camera, or even show ID if the platform cannot easilty detect age)
