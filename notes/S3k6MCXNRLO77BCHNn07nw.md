I started playing CS2 last month and I'm still getting used to all the maps and weapons. The AK-47 is my favorite so far, but I'm terrible with the AWP. Yesterday I found this [cs2 wiki](https://dmarket.com/cs2-wiki/) that has helped me learn the callouts for Dust2 and Mirage. I'm also looking at some skins there - thinking about getting a cheap skin for my USP-S to start my collection. The prices for some of these knife skins are crazy though! I can't believe people spend hundreds of dollars on virtual items. For now, I'm just focusing on improving my gameplay and maybe getting a few affordable skins. Has anyone tried the StatTrak weapons? Are they worth the extra money or should I just stick with regular skins?
