# Digital Menu Boards: The Fast Track to Better Drive-Thru Performance
Modern customers are also fast, clear, and interactive even in their drive-thru service. Old-fashioned stationary menu signage just cannot keep pace. Introduce digital menus, the disruptive technology that is changing the way quick-service restaurants (QSRs), coffee shops, and fast-casual brands interact and sell at the point of order.
## What Are Digital Menu Boards
[Digital menu boards](https://nento.com/digital-menu-boards/) are animated LCD or LED screens that are driven by software to display menus, promotions, and branding material. They can be updated in real time from a central point, unlike printed boards. They can also use motion graphics and video, and even change depending on time, weather, or sales information. This is what makes them a necessary instrument in the modernization of customer communication.
## The reason Why Drive-Thru Digital Menu Boards are a Game-Changer
The drive-thru channel is a high-stakes environment where speed and accuracy are directly related to revenue. Digital drive-thru menu boards can transform this important customer experience into a potent marketing and selling machine.
They work. Studies indicate that [drive thru digital menu boards](https://nento.com/digital-menu-boards/drive-thru-signage) have the potential to grow average check size by 3–8% with targeted upselling, and can also considerably enhance order accuracy. They can encourage customers to buy more by showing colorful, high-quality pictures of the menu, which can shorten decision time and help reduce delays.
## The major advantages of the Digital upgrade
1. Active Upselling and More Money
 Strategic merchandising is easy with digital boards. They can automatically focus on high-margin products, encourage combination offers with attractive images, and present limited-time offers (LTOs). Animated arrows and callouts help direct the customer toward what you want to sell the most.
2. Agility of Operation and Control in Real-Time
 Days of staff scrambling to alter plastic letters are gone. Using cloud-based software, headquarters or a single manager can change menu items, prices, and promotions across all locations in minutes. This is essential for daypart menu changes (e.g., breakfast to lunch), reacting to ingredient shortages, or coordinating national campaigns.
3. Improved Brand Consistency & Image
 Sharp and vivid displays create a fresh and professional brand image. Customers view the same quality graphics and fully formatted menus, which maintains brand identity and confidence with each visit.
4. Better Service speed and accuracy of orders
 Digital menus are well-lit and clear, which minimizes miscommunication. Customers can see what they are ordering in detail, which results in fewer corrections and a smoother, faster flow of transactions between the speaker and the window.
## Key Capabilities to Drive-Thru Success
When choosing a drive-thru digital menu board system, put an emphasis on the following features:
High-Brightness Displays: Screens should be readable even in direct sunlight.
Rugged Hardware: Screens and media players should be resistant to heat, cold, and weather.
