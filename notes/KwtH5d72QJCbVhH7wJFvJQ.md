### **Market Segmentation**

The glue-laminated timber market is segmented based on type, product type, resin type, application, end-use sector, and regions.

#### **By Type**

l **Standard Glulam**: Standard glulam is widely used for structural applications in residential and commercial construction, particularly in roof beams, floor systems, and wall framing. This type of timber is known for its strength and durability, making it ideal for load-bearing applications.

l **Customized Glulam**: Customized glulam is tailored to meet specific project requirements. It offers flexibility in design, making it suitable for projects with unique architectural needs, such as curved beams or custom-length supports. The growing demand for custom-designed structures is driving the adoption of customized glulam.

#### **By Product Type**

l **Floor and Roof Beams**: Glulam beams are commonly used in floor and roof systems due to their strength and resistance to bending. They offer a high load-bearing capacity and can span longer distances than solid wood beams.

l **Replacement Beams**: Glulam is increasingly used to replace older, worn-out beams in existing structures, offering a sustainable and durable alternative to traditional materials.

l **Household Framing**: Glulam is gaining popularity in residential construction for framing applications, providing strong yet lightweight solutions that can support the structural integrity of homes.

l **Window & Door Headers**: The use of glulam in window and door headers offers improved stability and load distribution, making it an ideal choice for high-stress areas in construction projects.

l **Supporting Columns**: Glulam's compressive strength makes it suitable for use as supporting columns in both residential and commercial buildings.

l **Ridge & Curved Beams**: The architectural flexibility of glulam allows for the creation of curved beams and ridges, providing design freedom while maintaining structural strength.

#### **By Resin Type**

l **Phenol Formaldehyde (PF)**: PF resin is a widely used adhesive in glulam production due to its water-resistant properties. It is commonly used in exterior applications, where durability and resistance to moisture are crucial.

l **Polyurethane (PUR)**: PUR resin is known for its high strength and flexibility, making it a preferred choice for projects requiring load-bearing capacity and structural integrity.

l **Melamine-Urea-Formaldehyde (MUF)**: MUF resin is often used in interior applications, where moisture resistance is less critical. It offers strong bonding and cost-effective production.

l **Others**: Other resin types include urea-formaldehyde and epoxy, each offering specific benefits for different applications and project requirements.

#### **By Application**

l **Floor and Roof Beams**: Glulam is a popular choice for floor and roof systems in residential, commercial, and industrial construction due to its strength, durability, and ability to span large areas.

l **Replacement Beams**: The use of glulam for replacing aging beams in renovation projects is gaining traction, providing a sustainable and high-performance alternative.

l **Household Framing**: Glulam is increasingly used in household framing for its flexibility, strength, and environmental benefits.

l **Window & Door Headers**: Glulam is ideal for window and door headers due to its ability to withstand high loads.

l **Supporting Columns**: Glulam supporting columns are used extensively in structural applications where stability and load-bearing capacity are essential.

l **Ridge & Curved Beams**: Architects are using glulam for ridge and curved beams to achieve aesthetic appeal and structural strength in modern designs.

l **Other Applications**: Glulam is also used in decking, bridges, and various other construction applications.

#### **By End-Use Sector**

l **Residential**: The residential sector is a significant driver of demand for glulam, with its use in framing, roof systems, and beams increasing due to the material's sustainability and performance benefits.

l **Commercial**: In commercial buildings, glulam is used for large structural applications such as beams, columns, and floor systems. The material's strength and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for modern commercial designs.

l **Industrial**: Glulam's strength and durability make it suitable for industrial applications, including warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and agricultural structures.
