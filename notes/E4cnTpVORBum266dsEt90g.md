## 專案簡介


### 緣由

Activities are an important component in the college application. Some students may not be aware of the importance of activities until they are about to apply to colleges. Others may have no ideas about how to initiate impactful activities.

### 要解決的問題

To help students initiate meaningful and impactful activities, this project aims to design a proprosal worksheet and a platform to collect successful actions. 

### 預定使用者

The proposal worksheet are designed for high school students in College and Career Readiness Class 10, 11, and 12. After writing a proposal, students are expected to excute their plans according to the steps that they design. 

### 預定功能

The worksheet should be able to help students identify an issue that they care about and think about how to solve the issue. The plaftform will be an inspiration for students.

### 現有類似專案

G0V has many successful projects, which can be models for our students. IBDP curriculum also includes a component called CAS (Creativity, Action, and Serice), which can provide some guideline for this project.

### 相關專案

Besides the worksheet, we can collect successful projects in a spreadsheet, which may inspire our students to launch related projects to solve the unresolved issues. 

### 授權方式

The projects that we collect need to be open resources with CC or CC-BY.

### 使用資料
