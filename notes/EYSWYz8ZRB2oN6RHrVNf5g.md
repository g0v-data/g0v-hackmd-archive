## What is "Herstory in East Asia"
We want to show "herstory" in East Asia from local perspectives with a timeline and a map in our local languages, so that people from different regions of East Asia can learn more about the stories and rights women and LGBETQ+ have fought for.

"Herstory in East Asia" project was launched in [Facing the Ocean Hackathon](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@chihao/HJuTOqB74?type=view) in Okinawa, Japan with contributors from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong. 

We realized that we have experienced similar culture repression and that we can learn from movements in other places, e.g. equality in workspace, law against sexual harrasement, right of abortion and campaigns against online hate speech. We knew too little on our neibours stories in gender equality.

We wish to publish the website to the public on March 3rd –Hina Matsuri– in Japan and March 8th – International Woman Day.

We want women in East Asia to know we have gone so far for the past 100 years and more can be done in the future.

:::info
[Facing the Ocean Meet&Hack](https://tinyurl.com/ftofto) is co-organized by [g0v-international](http://g0v.asia/) from Taiwan, [Code for Japan](https://www.code4japan.org/) and [Parti](https://parti.coop/) in Korea.

### What is "Herstory in East Asia"/‘허스토리’ 란 무엇인가 [Korean/한국어]
Herstory(이하 '허스토리')는 동아시아(대만-일본-한국-홍콩) 여성들의 이야기, 여성과 LGBETQ+들의 인권운동, 페미니즘 운동을 기록하고 공유합니다. 5개 언어로 각국의 여성 이야기이자 여성인권운동의 살아있는 역사를 쓰고 모아서, 타임라인과 맵핑으로 비주얼화 된 페이지를 선보일 예정입니다. 

본 프로젝트는 지난해 오키나와에서 진행된 "Facing the Ocean 밋&핵"시빅 해킹 행사에서부터 시작되었습니다.올해는 3월 3일 일본 히나 마쓰리와 3월 8일 국제 여성의 날에 맞춰 '허스토리'를 여러분에게 공개하고자 합니다. 우리는 동아시아 여성들이 우리가 지난 100년 동안 성취해온 것과 미래를 담은 우리의 이야기를 공유하고 함께 변화를 이끌어가고 싶어요. 

* 이 프로젝트는 'Facing the Ocean Meet&Hack' 커뮤니티; 한국의 사회적협동조합 빠띠, 대만의 g0v international, 일본의 코드포 재팬이 공동으로 오거나이징합니다.    

###  What is "Herstory in East Asia" /Herstoryとは何か？ [Japanese/日本語] 
完全日本語版説明はこちら▶︎ https://g0v.hackmd.io/dqkc-v68R16bZgtyOtxKTQ
私たちは、東アジアのさまざまな地域において、女性やLGBTQ+の人々が戦ってきたストーリと得てきた権利についてより多くを学ぶことができるように、タイムラインと現地言語の地図を使用して、地域の視点から東アジアの「遺産」を残したいと考えています。

"Herstory in East Asia"はCode for Japanがg0v(台湾)、g0vHK(香港)、Parti(韓国)らと共同で開催していたハッカソン Facing the Ocean Hackathon の第１回（沖縄開催）にて開始されました。コントリビューター(協力者・参加者)は各国から集まっています。

同じ海に面する私たち東南アジアの国々は、同様の文化的背景を共有しており、お互いの経験から学び合うことができることに気づきました。 労働における平等、性的ハラスメントに対する法律、中絶の権利、オンラインのヘイトスピーチに対するキャンペーン。 私たちは、ジェンダーの平等に関する私たちの隣人の話についてほとんど知りませんでした。

3月3日の桃の節句(雛祭り)や3月8日の国際女性デーにWEBサイトを公開したいと考えています

Japan:
* Dec. 24 
* 

Taiwan:

* website:
* UI, website
* 


Future collaboration?

Problems:


**To Do**

1. We have to talk to Nullfull, code for Japan, g0v on future goals and collaboration method
2. Tell other countries what you are doing briefly (It's okay to in your own language in detailed documents)
3. website development first, we can wait for the contents
4. find ways to reduce communication barriers

**Coming events**




**Unorganized notes below:(will be organized later)**


Miley_Mami
Satoshi
https://ccc2020.code4japan.org/
We held civictech award for student this year
because of COVID-19
students lost the chance to join summer interns.
so we made this for them.
OSF(Foundation in the US) interested in our project and they want to focus the issue about minority
11:15
What do you mean minority?
Mami: e.g. women, non-binary, ppl live in Japan from other countries
In 2021, we will try to make this award for the civic hacking on minority
Mami: we want to use the information from herstory for the students
Pei4 is now hosting herstory project from Taiwan
11:19
Miley_Mami
new web site
11:21
伊藤詩織
11:23
Miley_Mami
g0v summit 2018, one of the speaker from India, talk about the gender-gap of Wikipedia.
11:24
Pei4: drawing and social media campaigns => for more people to know the events
jerry: we want to know what every country wants to do. We don't have to do it in the same way of the same thing. It is hard to find what we want to collaborate. We can discuss what we want to do now
ael: I think the future direction is better on experience sharing and online opinions sharing and translation
so you want Janpanese students can talk to TW, HK, KR students on gender issue
Is that what you mean?
Mami: first step for students is the website, second step is online/offline discussion
webiste to know the history
11:28
Miley_Mami
Kazuki, Kazuki2, Mami and I(Mami2) are the member who working on gender issue.
4people
陣内 and 今村 is the last name of them
Kazuki陣内 is the man
Kazuki今村 is the woman
Herstory is the net work for the people who want to work on gender issue
JPN：in 2021, we want to make the online discussion and then they will bring that for ideathon and hackathon.
Maybe today I will maintain the spreadsheet add more Japanese translation.
11:35
Local team using their own language on local issues. International support and networks in #herstory. If other contries want to do , they have references and know who to ask
JP: ideathon -> 1 month prototyping -> 

this year 100 students
some political issues
accessibility translation

important for them to talk with other working in civic tech
Mami: will make some info to share. Maybe ask your guys to join the workshop
ael: maybe the next thing is to consider how to sync progress in different countries. e.g. cross-channel bot
ael: maybe sharing and updating gender issues in each country is more comfortable for us. Local team initiate and run their own projects and then ask for support from other countries
especially gender issue with civic tech
We will talk to Mee today
to see what she thinks
2-3 months have a call to catch up and share
11:45
Miley_Mami
herstory will be the platform for each countries civic hacker😃
11:46
ael: I am thinking how to connect and sync different local discussion channels
jerry: or email group?
minimize the extra communication efforts
11:51
Miley_Mami
overseas-herstory
is the public channel
11:52
in Code for Japan
Mami san is translating English discussion in g0v Slack to Japanese
we probably can use archive bots and other subscription. we can work on that later
I will ask Mee what Koreans are doing and their discussion channel
it is about info and experience sharing. It  is okay to use your language in Slack channel. someone else will help translate is. It is also ok to share documents, articles, videos in your language
11:58
Miley_Mami
Thank you Jerry and ael!!

Mee: communication closely
nullfull Slack also has #herstory channel
Mee: communication in email. Once a month to share the gender issue: what we contributed, insights. usually sharing via email is better
Mee intercommunicate between different channels
Mee: maybe we can be connectors. not everyone can do intercommunicate
Mee: Korean contributors think we are already done, so they move to other projects
Jerry: we don't have to the same thing. It is what each country team wants to do
e.g. Japan's plan is to host student hackathon on gender issue
Mee: once a week to project work at that time. we have a checklist. herstory is on Nullfull checklist
jerry: expectation on the project?
Mee: we need to discuss the gender issues more. Herstory project is not complete. Maybe a deadline next year Woman Day
Mee: Nullfull thinks the content is finished. herstory should be updated in a period. work together one month a year?
Mee: we can share more gender issues together
across the countries
We are waiting Japanese to finish their parts. Nullfull people run following the deadline.
Jerry: Japan wants to do workshop, using herstory as knowledge database and introduction for student hackathon
ael: what's your expectation on herstory outcomes?
check on website development
airplane passing
herstory channel 17 people in Nullfull
Nullfull way: short time focus and then move on, events=> do it again
now is fluidto coordinating everything
we want to know how Nullfull work
task force set up deadlines and move on to next projects.
once a month we have a hackathon, we work on that day, translating. weekly talk about weekly checklist. some people contribute to project checklists or other projects
ael:
ael: but we didn't know Korean process ><
Mee: Femenists work very hard and put many contents to push the milestones
ael: maybe I should ask fluidto what is her expectation of the project
earthquake just hit
ael: we should have more updates to each other
update what our country does every 1-2 months
14:38
jerry: monthly basis update!
14:38
ael
release the documents and videos in your own languages on different flatforms
If we want to finish the website, now it is SL time and Japanese content. For herstory future, I think it is hard to maintain a website with deadlines to meet. each country can do whatever they want, and herstory is more like a platform and network for experience sharing
Mee: finish the website is still the clear goal for Nullfull
Mee: we can meet up for gender issues twice a year. Keep in touch.
ael: for me, I want to minimize the efforts to finish the website
