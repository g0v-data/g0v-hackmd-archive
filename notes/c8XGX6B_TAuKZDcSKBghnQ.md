## Overview of Third-party Scripts and Importance
Third-party scripts are code pieces that are written in webpages from the sources outside instead of writing them inside the website. These scripts can perform different tasks including linking the different social media feeds amongst others like; tracking users actions on the site and placing ads on it.  Third-party scripts provide developers with a means by which they can add more advanced features to their sites that would either be too difficult to write from scratch or to continue from another point. It is necessary to manage these third-party scripts due to many reasons that include impacting on the performance of websites and speed thus affecting user experience positively or negatively.
