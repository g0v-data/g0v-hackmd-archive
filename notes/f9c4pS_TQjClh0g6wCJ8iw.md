## 給 vTaiwan 參與者的訊息中文版

大家好，歡迎大家來到 vTaiwan 工作組，不論你是從哪裡拿到連結，然後進入到這個地方，都非常感謝大家對於 vTaiwnan 的關注與支持！

vTaiwan 自從 2014 太陽花學運後創立，是當時的政府為了增進公民參與，在公民科技社群 g0v 零時政府提案後設立的成果。作為一個公私協力的數位法規調適平台，2015-2019年間，vTaiwan 在政府與民間的共同努力下，完成了許多政策與法規的修訂，並落實到政府的政策與法律中。例如 Uber、數位性暴力、無人運具等議題。

不過隨著政府逐漸與民間建立更多連結，以及越來越多社群參與者進入體制服務，vTaiwan 也持續面臨社群發展方向、政府的對口消失等挑戰，然而由於社群本身是公開透明且開放的，所以相關的成果與流程仍然能夠被保留在共筆文件上，讓有興趣的參與者可以隨時加入與重啟。在 2020年，vTaiwan 仍然有每週週三的小松活動，也有一群社群參與者持續進行貢獻。

在 2023 年，因為社群參與者一起與英國 Chatham House 合作，入選了 OpenAI 的 Democratic Input to AI 計畫，讓社群從 2023年7月又重新開始活躍。目前的社群參與者對內正在努力整理之前的各種文件、重新整發網站與共筆，並且也在持續維持並擴大社群。對外社群參與者也積極發展各項合作，利用合作的方式重新讓社群活躍起來，並擴大影響力！

希望以上的資訊能夠幫助大家更了解 vTaiwan，如果有任何的想法，都可以在g0v slack 上的 #vtaiwan 頻道提出，或者是寫信到 vtaiwan.tw@gmail.com 進行聯繫！

## Message for vTaiwan Participants

Here is the translation of your message into English:

"Hello everyone, welcome to vTaiwan working group. No matter where you got the link and entered this place, we are very grateful for everyone's attention and support for vTaiwan!

vTaiwan was established after 2014 Sunflower Student Movement. It was created following a proposal by the govenment to the g0v civic tech community at that time, to enhance civic participation to policy and law amendment.

As a public-private collaborative platform for digital regulatory adaptation, vTaiwan, between 2015-2019, accomplished many policy and regulatory revisions in collaboration with the government and the public, implementing them into government policies and laws. Topics included Uber, revenge porn, unmanned vehicles, and more.

However, as the government gradually established more connections with the public and more community participants entered the public sector, vTaiwan continued to face challenges such as the direction of community development and the disappearance of government counterparts. Nevertheless, because the community itself is open, transparent, and accessible, the related outcomes and processes are still preserved in shared documents, allowing interested participants to join and restart at any time. In 2020, vTaiwan still had its weekly Wednesday Komatsu events and a group of community participants continued to contribute.

In 2023, the community participants collaborated with the UK's Chatham House and were selected for OpenAI's Democratic Input to AI program, revitalizing the community from July 2023. The current community participants are internally working hard to organize previous documents, relaunch the website and shared notes, and also continue to maintain and expand the community. Externally, the community participants are actively developing various collaborations, using these partnerships to reinvigorate the community and expand its influence!

We hope the above information helps you understand vTaiwan better. If you have any ideas, you can bring them up in the #vtaiwan channel on g0v slack, or write to vtaiwan.tw@gmail.com for contact!"
