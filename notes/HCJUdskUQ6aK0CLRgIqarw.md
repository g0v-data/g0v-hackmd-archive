# Improving SEO with the Latest Changes in Google’s Algorithm for 2024
The search engine optimization (SEO) space is full of changes, and to be successful, it is important to keep abreast of the developments within Google’s ranking algorithm. In the present day, which is the year 2024, numerous modifications have been introduced by Google to how it ranks web content and presents it to the public; thus, businesses and content creators must make some changes. Among these changes are the increased shift towards artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence in search results, and more focused attention on mobile-first indexing, user intent, and experience. Placing importance on such changes and making smart modifications to the way one does SEO will, among other benefits, enhance the chances of a website being found, increase the volume of organic traffic, and help get the right content to the people it is meant for.

In this write-up, we look into the salient features of Google’s 2024 algorithm and offer practical tips on how to make your content and website remain relevant in the ever-changing landscape. To enhance the rankings and sustain a vigorous online presence, we’ll discuss the measures you can undertake ie. These include improving Mobile Page Experience, improving E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness’), and adjusting to AI search optimization.

## Key Changes in Google’s 2024 Algorithm

When it comes to the changes introduced by Google in the year 2024, several crucial changes were made in the factors affecting the position of the websites and the presentation of search results. These changes are indicative of the fact that Google is trying to achieve something more than just delivering the search results users have expected. For instance, there have been changes in the search results emphasizing more on artificial intelligence, a more pronounced focus on E-E-A-T (experience, expertise, authority, and trustworthiness), focusing more on user intent rather than keywords, and the mobile-first indexing approach. Let’s break these down further and discuss what implications these changes have on your SEO strategy individually.

### Increased Focus on AI-Driven Search Results
Among the anticipated changes to occur in the year 2024 is the use of AI by Google in search engines, with special emphasis on generative AI to improve search engine results. With the help of generative AI, Google can give more elaborate and context-specific answers to a person’s search query. For example, if an individual type in the text “best coffee makers of 2024,” rather than providing only a list of URLs, Google’s AI will most likely offer an overview of the best coffee makers, their attributes, and reviews from various sites on the differences of the coffee makers. This development implies that the content on the sites has to be of high quality and rich in structure such that the AI systems can effortlessly understand the content and produce the responses.

Attuning user search behavior is not limited to the query entered by the user but extends to understanding the entered query. In previous times, it was solely a matter of inserting the required keywords. Now, Google AI is advanced to the extent that it knows the semantics of the keywords. For instance, in the past, one had to state, 'How to fix a broken faucet,' and Google would only return lists of web pages with the words fix or faucet. Modern-day IR search, however, can also interpret the meaning of such a query, i.e., that the user is likely on the verge of looking for a very detailed story on how to go about fixing a broken tap and be able to provide solutions to that problem, as opposed to only submission of pages with that phrase. Consequently, with the emphasis that most SEO interventions address user problems, it is envisioned that content that will solve the challenge will be created naturally and comfortably, which will be AI’s ranking advantage for that content.

### Enhanced Importance of E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
The 2024 update of Google’s ranking algorithm places further emphasis on E-E-A-T, ensuring that only content that is experienced, knowledgeable, authoritative, and trustworthy is given decent ranks. The revision targets sectors where knowledge and persuasive ability are not a luxury but a core necessity, e.g., in medicine, banking, and legal operative services.

Looking at the overarching factors, it can be deduced that, for instance, if both sites offer articles on aspects of personal finance and one of them regularly includes articles from certified financial planners and has detailed author bios indicating their qualifications, then such a site will rank better than a simple personal blog. Simply put, this implies that to enhance your search engine optimization in the year 2024, you will have to spend resources on expert content creation by actual personalities with tangible backgrounds. Expert author biographies, proper referencing source inclusion, and overall clarity have become core components of E-E-A-T enhancement.

Google also takes into account the experience of users in the E-E-A-T model. When users engage with your content positively (for example, remain on the page for a longer duration, or share the content), it indicates to Google that your website contains helpful and reliable information. Authority is also built by getting links from preferred sites and getting positive content about you from trustworthy sources. For instance, if you are constantly referenced on their websites by relevant field authorities or citations obtained by influential journalists, these reinforce the authority of contents in the eyes of Google.

### Prioritization of User Intent and Query Context
The 2024 Google’s algorithm focuses greatly on search intent. The period when traffic could be generated by mere keyword location is over. Currently, Google assesses what users want and tries its best to deliver relevant content related to the user's request.

Imagine a case where a user types “best vegan restaurants near me.” Google now incorporates the location of the user, the search history of the user, and even the time of the day to display the most pertinent results. In this instance, a restaurant that has claimed its Google My Business profile, has provided a detailed description of what vegan food they serve, and has gathered many favorable reviews from the locals is better placed. This change has made it necessary for most businesses to ‘think globalization and act localization’ which, in this context, means adjusting their content to reflect the prevailing search patterns by carrying out demographic research on the location and providing timely and correct information on the services provided.

For instance, consider the case when someone searches for information on how to lose weight fast. Numerous sites may aim for the general word ‘weight loss;’ however, Google’s current technology focuses more on the content that meets the purpose of the search rather than its words alone. A more scientific and rational approach is favored, whereas unconventional or harmful practices are less prominent and instead are warded off. Hence it becomes important to remember that your users and their goals are present, or must be present, in the content for it to be ranked highly and informative.

### Shift Towards Mobile-First Indexing and Core Web Vitals
With the increasing cellular network access, Google has again emphasized its mobile-first approach to ranking indexing in 2024. This implies that Google looks at the mobile version of the site for purposes of ranking and indexing, thus necessitating the need for a mobile version of the site for businesses that wish to rank highly in search results.

This is a mobile era, and to disregard the standards of mobile usability for one’s website is to cause a lot of problems, especially ranking issues. For instance, a site that loads on a mobile phone in about five seconds is quite likely to have very low search visibility. There is a need to increase check on mobile responsiveness with most of them such that images are properly embedded and codes are optimized to better load times. A mobile-optimized website may have bigger text, buttons that allow for touch interaction, and a clear basic design that aids the interaction of users with the site.

Apart from the mobile-first approach to indexing, Core Web Vitals have also been integrated as a significant ranking factor. These metrics include the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), among others, which assess user engagement with your site. For example, if a website has a high CLS score, meaning that the contents of the screen shift at random as a user loads a page, users tend to get annoyed and exit the site, which results in poor rankings. Optimizing a site for Core Web Vitals means ensuring pages load within an acceptable time, that users can interact with the page immediately without any delay, and that there are no distracting layout shifts. Therefore, such websites are expected to rank higher than the rest, especially in this mobile era.
