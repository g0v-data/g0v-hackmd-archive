### Hashing
We use hashing to know that data has not been tampered with as well as to verify data. Simply put, hashing turns the data into a unique size fixed that is normally represented by a digest string of characters. Hash functions have no reverse functions. Once the data is hashed, one cannot convert it back to the initial form. They return a uniform length result irrespective of how long the input size may be to ensure that the hash output is consistent. It’s deterministic such that any given input will always generate similar hashes.

Hashing algorithms are meant to be speedy and effective, thus facilitating rapid calculations. Additionally, a good hash function reduces the chances of two different inputs producing similar hash outputs.

To securely preserve email passwords, save them to the database as hashes first. Make sure data has not been altered based off how different instances of this data compare with themselves in terms of their hashes on those instances. This is done by making use digital signatures in order to confirm whether a given set of information has been interfered with or not.

Popular Algorithms include:
- [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) (though it is now considered weak and not recommended)
- [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
- [SHA-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)

### Encryption
Encryption protects data confidentiality by transforming data into an alternative format that only authorized persons can decipher back to the original form.

Encryption algorithms are functions that can work in both directions; therefore encrypted data can be decrypted if the right key is available. Usually, the size of encrypted data differs from the source one. A decoder uses characters to decrypt this formatted information.

When it comes to hashing, computing is less intensive compared to the processes in encryption and decryption. Encryption is used to keep things a secret hence when the data is intercepted it cannot be understood by anyone without a certain key.
Common use cases include:
- Data Transmission: Encrypting data before sending it over the network to prevent eavesdropping.
- Data Storage: Protecting sensitive data stored on disk to prevent unauthorized access.
- Secure Communication: Enabling secure messaging and transactions.

Popular Algorithms include:
- [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

### When do I use Hashing?
Use hashing (along with salting) to securely store passwords. Hash functions like [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) or [Argon2](https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/argon2.html#:~:) are specifically designed for password hashing and provide additional security features such as key stretching. Also, use hashing to verify the integrity of data stored locally or fetched from a server.

### When do I use Encryption?
Use encryption to protect sensitive data being transmitted over the network. For example, using [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) (which relies on [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) encryption) ensures data is encrypted during transit. Also, encrypt sensitive data stored on the device to prevent unauthorized access. Flutter plugins like [flutter_secure_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) can help manage encrypted data securely.

### Verdict
Both hashing and encryption are crucial for different aspects of security in Flutter applications. Hashing is best suited for ensuring data integrity and securely storing passwords. Encryption is essential for protecting the confidentiality of data during transmission and storage.

For a robust security strategy, it’s often necessary to use both techniques in conjunction. For instance, encrypt data before transmission and hash passwords for secure storage. Adopting a comprehensive approach to security will help safeguard the application against a wide range of threats.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:crypto/crypto.dart';

// Function to hash the password
String hashPassword(String password) {
  var bytes = utf8.encode(password); // Convert password to bytes
  var digest = sha256.convert(bytes); // Hash using SHA-256
  return digest.toString(); // Convert the digest to a string
}

// Function to verify the password
bool verifyPassword(String enteredPassword, String storedHash) {
  var enteredHash = hashPassword(enteredPassword); // Hash the entered password
  return enteredHash == storedHash; // Compare the hashes
}

void main() {
  // User registration: hashing and storing the password
  String password = "password";
  String hashedPassword = hashPassword(password);
  print("Password successfully hashed and stored: $hashedPassword");

  // User authentication: verifying the password
  String enteredPassword = "password";
  bool isPasswordCorrect = verifyPassword(enteredPassword, hashedPassword);
  print("Password is correct: $isPasswordCorrect");
}
```

Explanation:

1. Import Packages:
   - `dart:convert` is used for encoding the password to bytes.
