# 2/1

## Quick notes
- Whitepaper has been translated into Chinese, but due to recent changes we're making adjustments, will share with you once done
    - https://network-goods.github.io/hypercerts-docs/
- Semester-long classes about Web3 x Commons at Taiwan University (#1 university in Taiwan), hypercerts will play a big part
- Web3 x Commons Chinese podcast "Ut0pia" to be launched early Feb, next episode hope to invite Holke or Carl to the show

## Team
- We focused on bringing in experienced professionals instead of crowdsourcing talents from our community, profile of the team
    - Legal from venture capitals
    - Fund raiser at g0v
    - Web3 x Social Good experts
    - ESG experts from corporate world
- With 5 individuals at core team we also built an incentive structure
    - Core team is issued fixed amount of hypercerts issued by ourselves on monthly basis
    - Part of our issued hypercerts would go to guerrilla contributors on case by case basis
    - A percentage of the fund raised would be used to buy back hypercerts from this team, percentage to be determined
    - We are in the process of figuring out the exact numbers that everyone is comfortable with 

## Legal
- There will be no legal entity for this team, all compensation is based on the issuance of hypercerts
- Tax deduction will be a benefit for the donors
    - Funding goes through a foundation we partner with
    - The foundation will take around 10~15% as commission
    - This makes talking to corporations much easier
    - We are choosing between two foundations, decision yet to be made

## Planning
- Goal
    - Showcase corporations would make donations retrospectively
    - Showcase contributors earn more than expected
    - Note : The transfer restriction made this experiment more focused 


- Theme of the campaign
    - Although we talked to many projects and teams, and many have shown interests, we thought it'd be better if we focus on one theme that is of interest to funders
        - Criteria
            - Of funders' interests
            - Easy to measure
            - Easy to showcase
            - Easy to scale (with projects)
                - ex. Plastics waste
- Timeline
    - We want to confirm dates for FtC as early as possible
    - Between now & Ftc
        - Raise fund till October, 2023, goal is now 500K USD
        - Under the same theme, involve 3~5 key showcase projects, open to more with workshops
        - Start preparation with FtC starting end of October

- Key proposition to funders
    - Participation in world's leading public goods experiment
    - Clear impact measurement under one theme
    - Tax reduction

- Key proposition to projects
    - Potential retroactive funding if you issue hypercerts


## Funding
- Confirmed 50K from PL
- Launch fundraising effort again in two weeks
- Shown interest
    - Dentsu Media Group
    - Huanan Commercial Bank
    - Taiwan Cement

## Projects
- Waiting for theme decision
    - Would require a bit more discussion and research
