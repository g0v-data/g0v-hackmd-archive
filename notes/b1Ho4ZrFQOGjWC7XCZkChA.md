We struggled for years with disconnected procurement processes where purchasing, receiving, and payments were handled in completely separate systems. Our team would create purchase orders in one system, track deliveries in spreadsheets, and then accounting would manually match invoices without any visibility into the original orders. The whole cycle was prone to errors and took forever to complete. Everything changed when we moved to [precoro](https://precoro.com/to/procure-to-pay-software) for our complete procure-to-pay process. Now the entire workflow from initial request to final payment happens in one integrated system. Purchase orders automatically generate from approved requisitions, receiving updates trigger invoice matching, and payments get processed based on verified deliveries. The visibility across the entire cycle eliminated most of our reconciliation headaches
