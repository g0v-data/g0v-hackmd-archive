Lessons learnt from designing/building/running civic technology tools

For example:

- What went well and how? => high developer engagement, community engagement, remote collaboration. Launch on deadline, realㄓ users. NGO empowerment
- What didn’t go well and why? => marketing, not closed enough to users in countryside
- What failed? => keep everyone. Built on existing open source projects. Cost too much? How to be sustainable?
- What led to success? => NGO knows the issues and stakeholders and make affective strategies. Excellent developers and designers. Good team spirit
  

Experiences from civic tech users

For example:

- Real-world impacts of using civic technology tools => 6 factories have been tore down, government released new open dataset
- Reflections on user experiences and how they could be improved => how to get into local networks? Unexpected users. Complex local stakeholders
```


Disfactory is a crowdsourcing reporting platform on illegal factories on farmlands in Taiwan, in order to decrease factory pollutions and accidents on farmlands.

Within 10 months, Disfactory has received >1500 report records and filed >200 official documents to local governments, resulting in demolition of 7 illegal factories and ~150 factories under examination out of ~55k illegal factories in Taiwan. In response, government agencies have allocated more resources in inspections along with clearer policy implementation agenda and open data in machine readable formats; land brokers and factory constructors are using Disfactory to convince stakeholders to comply regulations.

Disfactory was initiated in g0v.tw hackathon by Citizen of the Earth, Taiwan (CET)— a small crowd-funded environmental advocacy CSO without any prior web development knowledge. Disfactory later has attracted a core developer team of ~12 volunteers and >40 community contributors in weekly meetups for the past 18 months across 4 countries. The current product is an integration of anonymous and convenient reporting interface, data visualization and a CRM system that automates filing and tracking official documents to the governments to scale up crowdsourcing reporting.

In the talk, we will examine the key factors, UX methods and product development strategies used in iteration not only of success in 1) open collaboration momentum and culture integration of floating open source community participants and an organized CSO with intense advocacy agenda and 2) empowerment on CSO’s digital transformation and on civic tech community to design digital solutions embedded in advocacy, but also in ongoing challenges 3) to outreach and engage more rural users on the ground as an urban-based product team and 4) to raise public awareness under shadows of COVID-19.

**Explain how your proposal is relevant to the impacts of civic technology theme, and the learning outcomes for participants of your proposal***


While some civic tech researches or narratives are around government, large NGOs, corporates, analysis from academic disciplines or the technology itself, I care more about HOW ordinary citizens can create technologies that strengthen grassroots civil society.

From civil society side, we have tried “how to” build impactful civic tech products with limited resources in complex social contexts, especially for grassroots CSOs, who can’t afford A/B testing nor throughout user researches. The product development models are hence so different from startup, corporate software development or even hard core open source projects such as Linux.

Disfactory is an attempt to leverage open source community power and culture along with grassroots CSO’s advocacy expertise and energy to create visible and incremental impacts on environmental issues. We are in fact still struggling to create larger impacts and pivoting advocacy and product strategies. However, we would still like to share some learnings from our small success so far. The talk tries to conclude the methodologies we have tried and how we tested and revised our product hypothesis and development as a loose community. The research methods may not be very solid, neither is the impact measurement. Nevertheless, I hope this sharing can be a starting point to inspire more discussion on civic tech product management and community collaboration models for grassroots communities. I am looking for experience sharing and learning from other communities. May the littles have the power to act via technology.

Learning outcomes from our experience sharing:
- What makes civic tech products useful? Professions on research,  networks, advocacy and stakeholders management + always align product development with advocacy goals and strategies(shared visions, North Star, scoping and metrics setting)+ be closed to the users (UX research and prototype testing)
- How to deliver features on deadlines with a constantly changing team? Small milestones and tickets with clear user stories and clear documentation. Raise the Bus Factor. Good developers and designers.
- How to build an energetic team? Build a comfortable working environment —fun, open source, rewarded, personal growth, autonomy and self-initiatives from individual contributors. Be agile and retrospective. Remove communication obstacles.
- How to empower CSO’s digital literacy? Culture integration instead of culture conflicts or invasion. Digital literacy is about mindset and collaboration culture changes not only tools. Create an experimental case to demonstrate the value and practice the new process and strategies.

impact

Disfactory is a crowdsourcing reporting platform of illegal factories on farmlands in Taiwan. The platform requires only photos and location to report, keeping the process anonymous and convenient. 

The system has been co-developed by g0v.tw community and Citizen of the Earth, Taiwan, an environment advocacy CSO.

10 months after launch, Disfactory has received over 1500 report records and sent out over 200 official documents to local governments resulting in demolition of 7 illegal factories.

The collected data is also used in collaboration with other CSOs in advocacy and successfully pushed the government to open more related datasets in machine readable formats.

Collaboration model and CSO empowerment

Beyond advocacy impacts, Disfactory also demonstrates a hybrid liquid collaboration model between CSO and open source community and empowerment of CSO digital capacity through the project.



Unique collaboration dynamics between NGO and open source community participants

- Weekly core participants ~10, 
- overall contributors > 40
- 18 month so far





Product development circle, roadmap and milestones. User research (Persona, usability testing)

How to build a team: How to recruit and make people stay. Motivations

Make product development methodology into Liquid collaboration. 

//compared to several open source collaboration models?

Limitation -> experiments -> solutions

Challenges and rooms for improvement

- Gap between countryside users and urban developers
- Marketing to local networks
- Monitored data -> really accountability
- 





Merge design

Iterative development ( so common)

Crowdsourcing 

Impacts:

- Reports number: in 10 months -> 3 factories down (?)
- Campaign
- NGO empowerment: remote friendly collaboration, learn data driven thinking. Make NGO staff be a product manager
  

(Crowdsourcing report platform )



 to everyone to join the movement to protect the farmlands from illegal pollution or accidents.

Claudia feedbacks:
> build coalition outside of civic tech community, only with government not NGO. building partnership , local org collaboration => submit this to Code for America.
> Culture change in NGO
> able to crowdsource (give out power) with an NGO
> here is the problem we still have so far
> Code for America CfA
> mask application fall apart, peopledon't think about sustainability, no volunteer management system, what di i do after joining Slack, too much on personal glory
> real reasons people are doing this: fun and profession growth+ project growth
> want to be hero without knowing what community really needs
> not willing to share decision making power => OpenAPI
> Show expertise and controls in US
> Competition
> Humidity 
> Be aware of what you don’t know
