This note is documented by mg lee. It only covers what I attended during 2016 OGP Summit @Paris. CC0.


## 12/8 [Open Parliament](https://en.ogpsummit.org/open-parliament/)

_Personal feelings: Around 50-60 attendees, many wearing suits. Feeling lack of diversity and  the voice of civil society (with a few on stage) and (esp.) activists. Many conversations focus on the political perspectives of transparency, openness and equality, but not many case studies and the demo of what open data or civic tech has brought new light. _

Two parts: morning about Assembly (and inside France Assembly), afternoon about Senate (inside the Senate).

### opening remarks 2 /Mrs. Maura Boldrini, President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies

- fake news contributed to populism

(running in late...)
### first-run QA

- g0v: multi-centralized
- Q: Is there any country that publish spending data? A: Greece may be one among the few.

### 2nd topic: citizen engagement

g0v: vTaiwan
ODD: no more hackathons. open data doesn't mean change. if building civic tech means building another tech, it doesn't mean change.
Code for Germany: Create with not for.
[Civicia Digital](https://civica.digital/): bridging citizens and gov

### 3rd topic: DOs and Don'ts


## 12/9 Boosting engagement in open parliament

- Georgia: has the action plan of open parliament in our OGP declaration. There is indeed some move from the gov, but civil society plays a significant role. Achievement: it's able to see all the law draft on the parliament website.
- Costa Rica: before the action, there is nothing at all. we have to strengthen the administrative side of open parliament.
- Tunisia: we have emergent democracy within these 6yrs. Now we're drafting the new constitution, and in this new constitution we incorporate civil society. We can see a political will to work with civil society in order to have a more stable politics
- Kenya: trying to put open parliament into the law; parliamentary broadcast; example of co-drafting a bill thr app: about employment. traditional ways may be seen as "gov doing PR", so these new tools open a new possibility to engage with citizens.
- Ukraine: our action plan is made after the revolution of 2014 as more activists and journalists were taking seats in the parliament.
- QA
    - Someone asks broadcasting; Mg asks any example of releasing open-format parliament data?
        - Kenya: not yet, need more investment since many of the transcripts are still hand-written > pdf.
        - Tunisia: we publish our activities, calendar thr FB.
        - Ukraine: new gov has released a new website of open data

## 12/9 Civic tech, outils numériques participatifs : une révolution en marche ou des outils parmi d'autres ?

host: the main topic of this panel is "the reality of civic tech"

Panelists: Ilaria Casillo, Vice-présidente de la Commission Nationale du Débat Public ; Luc Belot, député de Maine-et-Loire ; David Prothais, [Eclectic Experience](http://www.eclectic-experience.net/)

- David Prothais: from digital gov to civic tech. citizens don't have time to attend council meetings and civic tech provides a solution to conquer the obstacle of time and location.
- Chicago example: we didn't think about civic tech but starting from public data. civic tech as empowerment. example of open school data. example 2: [My building doesn't recycle](http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/).
- Bassem: not civic participation but dialogue. we "co-construct" the city space.


## 12/9 Les contributions citoyennes à l'action législative et exécutive des gouvernements

(coming in late) (這場要放空了 lah lah lah)

#### 有火花的 QA

Q: "I'm upset that as a part of civil society, we have no dialogue at all at this summit".
A: moderator:  you can host a session. our sessions are all crowdsourcing!


## 12/9 Civic perspectives on OGP civil society and government collaboration mechanisms

Panelists (right to left): Tim Hughes (UK), Nkem Ilo (Nigeria),  Ching Jorge (Philippines), moderator Jean-Noé Landry (Canada), Ken Coghill (Australia)

Nkem Ilo: how OGP framework can set up the platform for civil society
Ken Coghill (Australia): the change is that now civil society has been seen as the advisors of policy-making. A mutual confidence is building btw gov and civil society.

Q1: what we should do if civil society is told to do EVERYTHING!
Q2: Nigeria is not yet a member. How you select the "representative" of civil society?
Q3: how to ensure civil society is an equal partner with gov?

Philippines A: under OGP, we put civil society and gov as equal members. Yes, we do select members of CSOs. We also travel to every corner of the country to make sure we heard all voices.
Nkem Ilo: Social media also help to engage with the general public who may not have specific interest on tough issues.

Q1: selection & diversity.
Q2: stories of failure? lesson learned?
Q3: space of civil society is shrinking! what's the reaction of OGP.

Ken Coghill (Australia): what we did fail is to fight against corruption and it's still oning.
Nigeria: gov is pushing back. There is also conflict within civil society >> who to lead, problem of representation.

## 12/9 [Measuring Transparency](https://en.ogpsummit.org/osem/conference/ogp-summit/program/proposal/527)

- what to measure: access to information, eps. gov info.
- And who to measure and be measured.
- factors to be noted:
    - quality of information;
    - institutional framework
    - should not see gov as a whole but look carefully into different agencies of gov.
- there is no single measurement. we need multiple, complementary tools.
- transparency about what & how we do to measure transparency

Comments
- gender aspect should be considered
