@ admin (aka Beta Dude LOL)

There are actually several videos of guys using PUA skills and failing miserably on youtube – I just posted the couple of links I found.

Perhaps it would be good to just have a section on this site to just post the links to these PUA fail videos – that way, the guys “sitting on the fence” about believing whether the seduction community is legit could be bombarded by these videos and then make up their mind based on other views of the seduction community.

For the journalist idea – journalists are always looking for interesting stories and Valentines Day is coming. Perhaps a journalist would appreciate a lead (it could just take an email to a newspaper) that a story exposing the seduction community would be very interesting.
