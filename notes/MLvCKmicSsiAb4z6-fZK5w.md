 Problem:
Eliminating poverty is one of the global Sustainable Development Goals. However, in many places, poverty remains a serious issue. Poverty manifests as people lacking sufficient income or resources to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, education, and healthcare. This leads to social inequality, health problems, and social instability.

Causes:
1. Lack of Education: 

Limited access to education restricts individuals' ability to gain better employment and income.

2. Limited Job Opportunities:

 High unemployment rates and a lack of decent job opportunities prevent many people from achieving economic independence.

3. Unequal Distribution:

 Unequal distribution of resources and wealth results in a small portion of society holding most of the wealth, while the majority falls into poverty.

Solutions:
1. Education Investment: 

Provide impoverished populations with more educational opportunities, including basic education and vocational training, to enhance their skill levels and increase job prospects.

2. Promote Economic Growth:

Support small businesses and entrepreneurship to encourage economic growth and create more job opportunities.

3. Social Security and Welfare Policies: 

Establish social security and welfare systems to provide impoverished populations with basic living security, including food, housing, and healthcare.

4. Reduce Inequality: 

Implement policies to reduce the unequal distribution of wealth and resources, ensuring a fairer allocation of resources.

Eliminating poverty requires comprehensive policies and international cooperation to ensure sustainable development on a global scale, while focusing on meeting basic needs and promoting social equity.



To promote cooperation between Taiwan and the United States in the sustainable elimination of poverty, the following approaches can be taken:

1. Knowledge Sharing: 

Taiwan and the United States can facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices, especially in education, vocational training, innovation, and technology, to help impoverished areas enhance their skill levels and create more employment opportunities.

2. Technological Collaboration: 

Foster cooperation between Taiwan and the United States in clean technologies, renewable energy, and environmental protection to improve the quality of life and reduce environmental impact.

3. Financial Support: 

The United States can provide economic aid or cooperation funds to support impoverished areas in Taiwan, including infrastructure development, social security, and healthcare.

4. Policy Coordination:

 Both parties can coordinate policies to collectively address poverty issues, including social security, labor rights, and reducing inequality policies.

5. International Organization Collaboration:

Taiwan and the United States can work together in international organizations to advance the global poverty and sustainable development agenda.

6. Private Sector Engagement: 

Encourage the business sector and social enterprises to invest in impoverished areas and undertake corporate social responsibility projects to create employment opportunities and improve community life.

These collaborative approaches can help Taiwan and the United States jointly address sustainable poverty elimination, enhance the quality of life for people, promote sustainable development, and serve as a model for the world.
