> [點此觀看原始內容](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/iQ4k573wtIX)


## Goal: To raise $15,000 ~ $25,000

### Budget?

> what's the budget plan on this?! Why $25,000?
> [name=Eric T]

> wow I like this number!
> [name=Hsin H]

> I'd like to have $25,000 for budgeting but why so much?
> [name=Eric T]

> Well, I just made up this number. I think at least we will need 15,000. 
> [name=Yen-Fu L]

> might have to explain/justify why $25,000... it will help when asking for larger amount of donation
> [name=Chiohh C]

> budget sheet required. Need someone with finance background to do this. Wasn't there someone who said they were consulting? Time to bust out those excel sheets
> [name=Eric T]

> This number depends greatly on how big the event we want
> [name=Yen-Fu L]

> Need to form a budget committee asap and core team to figure out the scale of the event
> [name=Eric T]

> I think let's do 100 people event $1,5000 for now - makes sense?
> [name=Hsin H]

> No event plan no budget, No budget no sense haha. 
> [name=Yen-Fu L]

> $150 per person?  Will lodging be provided?
> [name=Chiohh C]

> $1,5000 includes venue costs and so on, so not quite $150 per person
> [name=Hsin H]

> you can also split venue cost per attendee... that's okay.   
> [name=Chiohh C]

> are you guys having speakers?  traveling cost for the speakers?
> [name=Chiohh C]

> Roughly, not sure if it makes sense: $2K - 3K venue, $4K - 6K speaker, $2K food, rest - everything else 
> [name=Hsin H]

> so probably need $1,5000 - 20,000
> [name=Hsin H]

> So I just looked at DC's budget/actual.... not including speaker expenses... it was about $80 per person (venue/food/etc... no lodging...)  
> [name=Chiohh C]

> If we use $80 per person x 100 ppl = $8,000. 
> [name=Cheng-Chien K]

> Venue cost in NYC is more expensive than DC. ( + $2,000 ), 
> [name=Cheng-Chien K]

> Two speakers from Taiwan ( $3K each = $6,000 )  
> [name=Cheng-Chien K]

> one speaker from NYC ( $500 ~ $1,000)
> [name=Cheng-Chien K]

> I'd say $1,7000 as our target.
> [name=Cheng-Chien K]

> How about Lodging and Travel subsidies?  
> [name=Yen-Fu L]
