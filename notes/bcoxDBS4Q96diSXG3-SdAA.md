What could be the most surprising fact for you in the morning? It is your car’s starting failure. However, the most common reason for a failed start is a dead battery. Though an old battery might go dead frequently, the problem is not restricted to just old batteries, even a fresh battery might be dead due to a number of reasons.

However, it becomes necessary to find a solution for such an issue. Though a car battery replacement is a fair alternative, is it worth the investment to scrap a piece of battery that has enough life left?

In such a scenario, a jump start makes sense to get the life back in your car’s battery. However, a jump start is not the easiest of processes, as it requires certain care and has several inherent risks.

Here, we are going to discuss various aspects of jumping starting a car, particularly with a dead battery.

## Is a jump start pertaining any risk while considering safety?

However, a jump start is harmless when it is performed as per the standard procedure. A healthy battery does not suffer a serious impact during a process. Later, the car battery usually gets recharged during the drive.

Though the process might be a little rough, especially for the battery and alternator too, however, serious concern might arise if the process is not done properly. There might be some lapses that often put your car’s battery at risk, and even the entire electrical system, including the alternator, might get damaged.

If there is a larger battery that is going to power the vehicle (having starting issues), the electrical system is at the highest risk of damage. On the other hand, an alternator with a lower capacity is not going to supply enough current for a starter to apply enough force to turn over the engine.

Besides, there is a complex mechanism of computers inside modern cars. This makes these vehicles more susceptible to damage. Consider some evident examples of ECUs (engine control units) making essential decisions to run a car efficiently, informing the driver of a number of issues and requirements. Utilizing the cruise control and activating the air bags are done by the computer.

And, jump starting is a threat to such systems if done incorrectly. The damage may hurt to an extent, so it would be a better decision to write the vehicle off compared to opting for a repair.

However, call professionals from Service My Car if you find yourself in such a situation.

## Is it possible to jump start a vehicle with just help of a battery?

Though it is possible to jump start a vehicle with the help of a battery, But, most of the time, battery power will not be sufficient to deal with such a situation.

Usually, a charge-less battery (one behind a failed start) demands a considerable amount of charge during a jump start. This is the reason why a car needs a strong push to get started. Particularly, high RPMs make the alternator rotate faster and generate more current for a low-power battery.

Though there is a specific tool for charging purposes known as the jump starter booster pack, it consists of a portable battery having the capacity to push a dead battery with enough voltage to turn over the engine properly.

A newer vehicle needs a certain amount of voltage supply when the engine cranks. However, it works well for a healthy battery that has been discharged unconsciously. Otherwise, the bad battery (that is going to be dead soon) might not hold a charge when the alternator tries to charge it after a jump start.

Therefore, a car will stay on only if there is an alternator working, otherwise, you might find yourself struggling to start it again.

However, it is better to get your vehicle’s battery tested at Service My Car and be assured of the true condition.

## Is the battery too dead to jump start?

A car’s battery never goes too dead for a jump start. Even a car’s old battery can work with a jump start. However, if a jump start does not work, the alternator is at fault, or a dead battery needs a complete replacement.

Though there is no issue with jumping starting a car with a bad alternator, once you attempt a jump start and nothing happens, you learn about a faulty alternator.

Jump starting is more connected to a battery than an alternator. A faulty alternator might not be helpful in charging the battery again after a jump start.

However, what is necessary to keep in mind is that you should not attempt to jump start a damaged battery. A battery covered with some substance or even with a certain type of smell, such as rotten eggs, is not good for a jump start. Moreover, a battery that is not able to start the vehicle after a short period of rest is not feasible for a jump start either.
