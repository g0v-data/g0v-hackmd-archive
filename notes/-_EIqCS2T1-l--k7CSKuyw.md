Phu Quoc red pepper is hot and lingers in the mouth but is not extremely piquant. These exceptional peppercorns are harvested only when fully ripe and possess a complex flavor profile – floral and fruity, with delicate resinous notes. 
Ideally, it can also be used as a finishing touch on grilled meat, beef carpaccio, on fresh or sliced tomatoes sprinkled with olive oil. 
Wonderful when used to perk up pasta or on a classic favorite like ground pepper speckled strawberries.
