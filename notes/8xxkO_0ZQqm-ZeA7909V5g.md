## Directions to the venue
The venue is located in Seogwipo City (the second largest city on Jeju island). It is 10mins drive away from the city center, or 20mins by public transport.

### How to get to the venue from the airport
- Public Transportation
    - Take Bus 800 from G/F Gate 5, get off at 국세공무원교육원 공무원연금공단(혁신도시) (Government Employees Pension Service).
    - Bus comes every 15-20mins between 6:00 - 22:00
    - Total journey takes 1hr 10mins
    - Some buses may not take cash, so it is advised to buy a [T-money card](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/TRP/TP_ENG_8_1_1.jsp) at a convenience store in the airport and top it up. One way trip on bus 800 costs 5,000 KRW, so please add at least 20,000-25,000 KRW.
    - T-money can be used for subway, buses and taxis in most cities in Korea. Refer to this [link](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/TRP/TP_ENG_8_1_1.jsp) for more tips on using public transportation in Korea.

- Drive (taxi or rent a car)
    - If you take a taxi from the airport, the journey takes around 1 hour, and it will cost roughly 40,000 KRW. 
    - To rent a car as a non-resident, please refer to [this](https://blog.trazy.com/jeju-car-rental-guide/) article for more information.

> Travel tips:
> 1. Cash is rarely used nowadays in big cities, but it is still accepted in most stores. It would be useful to bring a credit card that can be used internationally.
> 2. SIM cards can be bought at the airport, but WIFI is available throughout the venue.
> 3. Google Maps may not be very accurate in Korea and it does not display our venue properly. Installing KakaoMap for navigation is advised.
