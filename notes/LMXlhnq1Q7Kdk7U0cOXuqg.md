徵求各語言適當的翻譯

Looking for proper translated names of all the languages listed below.

- English
    - 영어
    - 英語
- 日本語
    - Japanese
    - 일본어
- 한국어
    - Korean
    - 韓国語
- 華語
    - Mandarin
    - [Japanese]
        - Do people in Japan understand “華語”?
        - “中国語” is NOT preferable if there are other options
    - [Korean]
        - What is an appropriate translation?

> [name=chihao] In the spirit of respecting people from different regions/countries speaking their own version of Mandarin, I hope “華語” can be a general term that includes languages like Taiwanese Mandarin (國語), Chinese Mandarin (putonghua, 普通話), and other variants of Mandarin spoken in other places with sinoculture influence.
    
- 廣東話
    - Cantonese
    - 広東語
    - 광동어
    - alternatively: 香港話? / Hongkong language?
        > [name=chihao] What do people in Hongkong prefer? Given the current conflict with the China.
- 台語
    - Taiwanese
    - 台湾語 or just 台語?
        > [name=chihao] I think in Japan “台湾語” (sometimes? always?) refers to Taiwanese Mandarin not Taiwanese Hokkien.
