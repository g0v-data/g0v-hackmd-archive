> 以下提綱來自新新聞李又如。她要求現場協助翻譯，是否有口譯組可協助？
> [name=Jooooooey L]

> 我可以先翻成英文，在 PPI 訪談時先帶到，如果李願意、講者也願意的話可以接著訪問繼續對談。
> [name=Audrey T]

> 太好了，就這樣進行(我也會從旁協助)

> 時間這幾天會喬定。可能是在Gregory演講後或者是錄影訪談時間。我會寫信先告知Gregory
> [name=Jooooooey L]


> 海盜黨多年的開放式民主實驗，有改變德國人民的政治參與度嗎？例如民眾只願投票、不願意深度參與討論，這一點是否隨著時間演進有所改善？
> [name=Jooooooey L]

- Has the Pirate Party’s experiment in open democracy over a number of years changed attitudes towards political participation among the German people? For example, many citizens were only willing to vote but unwilling to participate in in-depth discussion. Has there been an improvement in this situation over time?

> 每一個事件的背景都相當龐大，如何確認參與討論的人都瞭解完整的脈絡？會不會有能力參差不齊的狀況？
> [name=Jooooooey L]

- Each social issue involves a large amount of background information. How can we ensure that those participating in the discussion fully understand the context? Would there be situations of uneven capabilities?

> 在台灣的小黨今年推派候選人就狀況連連，有自己獨立出來、有違反黨紀被開除，如何確保黨員的能力和理念是黨所需要的人才？海盜黨是來者不拒嗎？
> [name=Jooooooey L]

- In Taiwan, candidates nominated by small parties this year have faced numerous issues, including leaving to become independents and expulsions for breaches of party discipline. How can we ensure that the abilities and beliefs of party members reflect the talent that the party needs? Does the Pirate Party welcome all comers?

> 黨的經費少，但開放式民主所需的資源龐大，人力會不會是很大的困難？黨員如何全心投入在政治活動中，還是都必須要兼職？
> [name=Jooooooey L]

- The party has limited funding; yet open democracy requires vast resources. Will a lack of staffs therefore become a major problem? Can party members devote themselves to politics, or must they be part-timers?

> 誰能夠代表黨發聲？眾人皆能參與的決策機制時間會不會很漫長？如何形成具體的政策？「討論」真的能得到最好的結果嗎？倘若意見不合該怎麼辦？
> [name=Jooooooey L]

- Who can speak on behalf of the party? Will a decision making processes  that everyone can participate take too long? How are specific policies formed? Can “discussion” really produce the best results? What should we  do if there is disagreement?

> 海盜黨的組成全部都是「駭客」嗎？傳統政治訓練出身的老人們在黨內會扮演什麼樣的角色？
> [name=Jooooooey L]

- Is the Pirate Party mostly made up of “hackers”? What role can old people with traditional political training play in the party?
\-\-\-\-

### Richard D. Bartlett / Loomio, 14:50-15:10

-  How did the Occupy New Zealand movement shaped your group's missions and ideals?
-  You talked about getting Loomio into a decision-making protocol that's "bigger than email". How would it differ from the current Loomio 1.0?

## 個別題目：第二天

### [Clay Shirky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky), 13:30-14:10

> 村長說因為衝到Clay Shirky**想聽的議程所以對調**
> [name=Wei A]

- Density vs Scale: Graph theory, edges are all-or-none but rather a gradient. Do you have a more nuanced model of "weak ties" in the social media era?
- In HCE, you said people can use their leisure time as cognitive surplus, but actually the working hours has increased for the working middle class, so the quality of leisure time — thin sliced and too tired for constructive work — what strategies do you see that addresses this issue?
- We in g0v strive to narrate in an inclusive, neutral point of view, but we need to evoke emotions regardless, so how do we call up people's emotions — how to get them into a highly focused cohesion like Military and Sport, but without the anger caused by a common enemy? "Outrage without vilification?"
- The Decentralized model of [#U](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[m](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[b](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[r](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[e](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[l](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[l](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[a](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[M](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[o](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[v](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[e](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[m](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[e](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[n](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview)[t](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23UmbrellaMovement&via=Summit-visitors-interview) has explicitly been compared with GitHub, especially their place on the street is dynamic and fluid and relies on ad-hoc communication infrastructure based on FireChat and Telegram. But that also makes it rather hard to spin a linear narrative out of it — the closest we could get was children narrating their field experiences to their parents. From a media journalist's point of view, do you think there's perhaps an alternate way to get the bigger picture — for example in a large Linux ecosystem — outside the echo chamber?
- Wardley Map makes a competition-based ecosystem of progress. Do you have a  similar mental model for collaboration based social progress.
