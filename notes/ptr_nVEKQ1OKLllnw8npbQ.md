"Facing the Ocean(FtO)" is an event that brings together civic hackers from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan — the three neighboring countries that share and “face” the same ocean. It is co-hosted by contributors from Code for Korea, g0v, and Code for Japan.

"Sch001" project is a g0v project that focuses on education. Over the past 3 years, Sch001 invited contributors in the g0v community to transfer their experience of the Civic Tech project into courses and brought to students, educators, and newbies in the g0v community. Sch001 keeps being the bridge to connect schools and the g0v community to break the framework of school so that everyone can spontaneously collaborate across areas and ages and then change society through action.

As one of the community members, this year g0v Sch001 is honored to collaborate with National Democratic Institute to provide sponsorship for 6 students from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea to participate in the 2023 Jeju FtO Meet & Hack. The sponsorship will cover the international/domestic flight ticket for each participants. 

This sponsorship is also in collaboration with g0v jothon to publish the [Civic Tech Handbook](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@jothon/ctpbook) for Asia-Pacific community. During the FtO Meet & Hack event, g0v Sch001 will also hold two sessions to facilitate the discussions on the feedbacks and improvements on the Handbook. We'll invite all the students and participants to join the session
