## Intro

How do civic tech communities and projects nuture the growth of digital democracy? From independent projects that promote advocacy to PPP (public-private partnership) projects that coordinate with government agencies, what kind of factors could contribute to their success? And how do these factors strengthen our democracy?

In this research project coordinated with [Access Now](https://www.accessnow.org/) and Taiwan [Ministry of Digital Affairs](https://www.moda.gov.tw/) (moda), we’ll be looking into civic tech projects in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, interviewing community members and try to understand the accomplishments and difficulties each project have faced. After gathering community feedback at FtO Yokohama, we’ll perform another round of interview and organize the results into policy recommendations. 

Ultimately, we hope the outcome of this project could help digital ministries in East Asia to coordinate with civic tech community better, categorizing different factors (“resilience”) the government and the community could work together with. We’d like to invite all FtO participants to join the workshop!

- Code for Korea

### Workshop (13:30–14:00)

We’ll invite participants to share their experiences from their own projects—what are the lessons they’ve learned throughout the process? What was their experience on public/private partnerships, and how do they see their projects contribute on democractic resilience?

Finally, we will invite participants to think about the factors that would contribute to the community’s sustainability, giving out their own policy recommendations.

*Attendees may share their ideas during and after the workshop with sticky notes.

## Outreach

We’d like to invite all FtO participants who are willing to share their contribution experiences (especially on the impact of society and the cooperation with/supervising against governmental agencies) to talk with us during the FtO.
