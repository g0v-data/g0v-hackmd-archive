Smart City & Beyond üåÜ
How Technology & Urbanism Will Shape the Future

Abstract:Using Apps for finding a shop or restaurant or looking for some friends nearby is already a reality and millions of people all around the world are using those conveniences every day. By using ‚Äúbig data‚Äù and digitalization our cities can turn from mere clusters of people to smart cities‚Äîand help us to manage today‚Äôs and future challenges of growing cities in fields such as administration, urban planning, environment, economic development and others.¬† And in fact, many cities all around the world have implemented smart traffic systems or social media platforms to enhance communications in building blocks and whole neighborhoods. Besides mobility, transportation, and communication, social topics such as transparency, participation and better decision-making will be among the further developments of smarter cities.¬†

While there is much debate about the technological future of smart cities, the political perspective is often absent. This leads to the fact that Smart City workshops tend to rather be showcases of individual case studies rather than discussion platforms about the future of cities. Yet, these debates are necessary. Because especially in times of a pandemic density and therefore the very concept of urbanization came into questions. This workshop will provide a unique space to approach and discuss the topic of smart cities from a holistic perspective. Based on a first principles approach, this seminar will bring together technology, urbanization, and governance‚Äîand allow participants to dive into a variety a topics, ranging from urban planning and urban design, to the meaning and economics of cities, innovation, institutional competition and governance, entrepreneurship and progress, as well as the ethics of privacy.¬†
