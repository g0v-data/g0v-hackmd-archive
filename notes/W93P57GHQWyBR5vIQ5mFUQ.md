# Household Registration Office's system is terribly slow

> [點此觀看原始內容](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/5fTbxA8l2hs)


Monday morning (31/03/2014) in XinDian's Household registration Office, people had to wait 2 hours to get simple papers like a 戶籍謄本. Everybody was waiting, the staff and the people. I wrote a note and placed it in the suggestion box of the office:

###     "Your computer system is too slow. Some software engineers are willing to fix it for free. Please contact the organisation G0V."


Yesterday and today, I received this email as an answer:

###     郭先生您好，

###     有關您建議的事項因涉及資安及控管問題，有關系統維修(護)由主管機關內政部統籌辦理，很感謝您對本所提供之意見，本所會持續反映，希望可以盡速改善，為您提供更快更好的服務，有任何問題歡迎來電指教。

Is there anybody who would like to contact with them and see if there is a way to let us contribute ? (my Chinese might not be good enough to talk to them).

> I thought that they promised to fix it a while ago. Maybe now is the right time to propose an external help (us, programmers ?). To propose help is the first stage of a change, even if we know that it will probably be refused.
