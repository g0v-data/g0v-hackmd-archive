- Uk-Jin Yang

Korea: 300 legislators, 10 people under 40 y.old
Planning hackathon in June
Finding old people with young minds

Political parties in Korea often change name, as often as 5-10 years
Big party get new names, small parties grab their old name (so weird)

Founder of [http://likelion.net/](http://likelion.net/) is interested, so involved with the hackathon
Founder has a story like Steve Jobs

It’s going to be an open hackathon
Hackathons are not productive, more like making a story

Software engineers making idealistic designs
Politicians know the reality
They should know each other

華麗的假期
