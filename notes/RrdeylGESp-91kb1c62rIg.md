This project was run by Chatham House, vTaiwan and the AI Objectives Institute, together as one of ten teams funded under OpenAI’s Democratic Inputs to AI grant. It aimed to test recursion: a series of information cascades between decision-makers, communities and deliberations over time that we deem essential to good AI governance.

# vTaiwan堅持什麼？

Launched in 2014, vTaiwan is a decentralized open consultation process that combines online and offline interactions, bringing together Taiwan's citizens and government to deliberate on national issues. It serves as a model for People-Public-Private Partnerships (PPPP), involving government ministries, experts, civil society organizations, and citizens in crafting digital legislation.

In its ongoing role as a “shadow government,” vTaiwan is set to host more digital deliberative topics, particularly as regulations try to keep pace with rapid technological advancements. vTaiwan will continue to invite contributions from all societal sectors, initiating formal discussions when needs are articulated. Looking ahead to 2024, vTaiwan anticipates engaging with AI-related regulations, including the refined “Guidelines for the Executive Yuan and its Agencies on the Use of Generative AI” and the “AI Basic Law” by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).

As a dynamic, participant-driven space, vTaiwan strives to be a pioneering model in democratic consultation, leveraging technology to foster in-depth discussions on important national issues.
