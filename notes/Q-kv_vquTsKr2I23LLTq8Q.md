Truth defamation
exampted only for those for solely public interest

Peaceful demo should continue even when permit denied

Abolish truth defamation law in acc. with ICCPR
Abolish falsenews provisions
Revise Assembly Demo Act so that permit is notice, not a reason to stop demo (fine is fine)
Stop imposing liability on intermediary
pass intermediary liability safe harbour

### Simon Wright (NZ)

Instead of regulating the old, create new spaces
