## 一百年後走黃磚路：重塑傳統非政府組織之旅

Biography
I am a social doer involved in creating change. I spend most of my time helping make transparency an easy-to-follow way of life for people around me. I do so by challenging the known, tapping into the under-researched and bridging the gaps between different groups of researchers and activists alike. Besides heading TI Lithuania and overseeing the development of TransparencySchool.org for the past seven years, I have been involved in a number of undertakings that in many ways complement each other. I teach Corporate Governance and Anti-Corruption at the International School of Management in Vilnius. I am also a board member of the Lithuanian responsible business initiative "Clear Wave" and an advisory council member of the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Lithuania and the Žinių radijas. I have just joined supervisory boards of two healthcare establishments in Vilnius - the Central Policlinics of Vilnius and the National Vilnius University Hospital. I have also served as a local correspondent for Lithuania for the EU Commission Anti-Corruption report. As for other experiences under my sleeve, I was a member of the International Board of Directors of the global TI movement from 2009 to 2015 and a member of the Selection Commission of Candidates to the Judicial Office.

## morph.io: 國際公民科技社群建立的資料抓取平台

Biography
Henare was goaded into his first ever open source contribution in a chance encounter at a free software conference 7 years ago. Hacking on civic tech was the creative outlet for his passion for politics and open source that he'd been looking for. He's been volunteering at the OpenAustralia Foundation ever since and is now one of the first full-time staff where he does everything from software development to decoding government jargon into plain language. He has spoken at, and helped organise, civic tech and transparency conferences around the world and is a major contributor to several international open source civic tech projects. He has recently been teaching intensive scraping workshops. In these he has helped people with almost no programming knowledge write their very own scraper in just 4 hours. When not hacking democracy he is an enthusiastic amateur cook and is considered by some to be a master barbequist.
