A valid license is not just a legal formality. It allows you to sign contracts, process visas, open corporate bank accounts, and continue daily operations without risk. If the license expires, late fees apply and business activities can get restricted.

The professional license renewal also reflects your company's credibility. Clients, partners, and financial institutions often check your license status before working with you. A valid license builds trust and shows that your company follows regulations and operates responsibly.
