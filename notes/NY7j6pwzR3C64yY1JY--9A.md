## Introductions

### Susa
Susa 是由一群有想法、且想改變這個社會的學生所組成的學生專案社群。我們期望透過學生自主發起專案的方式，用我們現有的力量改變這個社會。同時，我們也希望在台灣或世界各地建立起學生做獨立專案甚至是創業的校園生態。讓更多學生投入創業或是為社會做出貢獻的行列。

Susa is a student project community formed by a group of students who have ideas and want to change the society. We hope to use our existing power to change this society through the way that students initiate projects on their own. At the same time, we also hope to establish a campus ecology for students to do independent projects or even entrepreneurship in Taiwan or around the world. Let more students invest in entrepreneurship or contribute to the ranks of society.

### Iquitos
Susa的核心精神為“讓學生開展屬於自己的冒險”，因此我們選擇了亞馬遜上游雨林的入口所在地，也就是秘魯東北方的邊境城市：Iquitos 作為此色盤的命名。寓意為“一切冒險的開始”，以凸顯Susa作為學生在台灣零時政府g0v社群中的“公民專案前哨站”的形象。期望Susa能為迷茫的學生在社群中找到讓他們可以發展並實踐公民專案的地方。

The core spirit of Susa is "Let students carry out their own adventure", so we chose the entrance to the upper Amazon rainforest, which is the border city in northeast Peru: Iquitos is the name for this color palette. The meaning is "the beginning of all adventures" to highlight the image of Susa as a student's "citizen project outpost" in the g0v community. It is hoped that Susa can find a place in the community for confused students to develop and practice citizenship projects.

## Style guide
- 為符合社群包容且多元的印象，引用這套設計系統時，盡量以==多彩==為主，大約使用==2個以上的顏色==
In order to conform to the original intention of inclusiveness and diversity, when citing this design system, try to make the design ==colorful==, and using about ==2 or more colors== in your design.

- 將色盤中的顏色與黑白色進行搭配是可接受的，但是==盡量不要搭配易使顏色更加混濁的灰色==
It is acceptable to match the colors in the color wheel with black and white, but ==Try not to match gray that tends to make the color more turbid==

- 在進行功能重要的設計時，請考慮到顏色辨識障礙使用者的使用情境，==避免將易使他們混淆的顏色放置在一起==（比如紅和綠）
When designing with important functions, please consider the use situation of users with color-recognition disabilities, ==avoid putting colors that confuse them together== (such as red and green)
