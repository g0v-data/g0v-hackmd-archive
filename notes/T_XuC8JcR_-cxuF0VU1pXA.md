#  Cofacts Editors’ Guideline and Policy

[If you have no editing experience please check out: Cofacts Database: Step-by-step Tutorial (start from logging in)](https://hackmd.io/s/rJ5k5lskb)



## Proper Format for Responding:
1. Include important information and summarize your response in under 140 words then submit it.
2. Material donation request: Write specifically about the time limit on where and when to donate.
3. Redefine the proper timeline: for example, replace any “this year”, “last year” or “end of the month” with specific year or date like “2017”, “2015/5/31”, etc.
4. Reference your work.


#### Most Credible Reference Source Ranking:
1st: Book, thesis, dissertation, official statement, professional media, etc.
2nd: Mainstream media, columns, opinion pieces, fan page posts, etc.
3rd: citizens' posts, videos, blogs.
(Editors' personal experiences can't be credited as a reliable reference source.)

### Situation 1: Contains personal perspectives.
There’s no need for verification if the message of the request post contains personal perspective, life experience, value, hypothesis, suspicion, conspiracy theory, unproven or untested research paper, political speculation, etc.

> The categorization is one of Cofacts’s biggest features. Check out our [Medium post](https://medium.com/cofacts/2017-8-16-%E6%96%B0%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E5%88%86%E9%A1%9E-%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E6%84%8F%E8%A6%8B-%E5%8F%83%E4%B8%8A-f96d92a9965f)on why we build this feature.

#### In the first field:
We provide a series of standard templates to choose from. (You can also edit the content for your reasons and explanation.)
"Contains unverifiable conspiracy theory."
"Contains slippery slope."
"Failed to reach an agreement."
"Merely a personal perspective."

#### In the second field:
In order to keep users aware of different opinions, please provide links of articles that have different perspectives from the original message. Personal opinions are also acceptable. You may provide more than one link and its description.

### Situation 2: Invalid request
With following situation happened, you may put the request in this category.
1. **A question**(e.g. “Is it true that AT&T is tracking my whereabouts with my mobile?”)
2. **Message contains URL only and its outdated.**(e.g.http://talk.ltn.com.tw/article/_____________) 
3. **Message contains only a news headline.**(e.g. Several Snack Foods Recalled After Potential Salmonella Risk Identified)
4. **Commercial or promotional advertisement.**（e.g. 7-11 or Disneyland Discount Tickets & Special Offers）
5. Chit-chatting with the bot.(e.g. “Hello? Are you a robot?”)
6. **Suggestions for Cofact LINE bots.**(The bot won’t respond to the suggestion but we thank you as developers and we’ll take into account.)
7. **Message too short and only contains keywords.**(e.g. “staying up late liver damage”)


### Situation 3: Contains true information
1. Write about which part of the message is considered credible information in the first field. You may reference, or clip a part of your reference to show your theory.
2. Put in links of the references with description in the second field, you may put in more than one link.

### Situation 4: Contains misinformation.
1. Write about which part of the message is considered false information in the first field and correct them with accurate information.
2. Put in links of the references with description in the second field, you may put in more than one link.


### Situation 5: Unable to verify the request with proper information, what should I do?
1. Please join our editors' Facebook group and start a new thread.
https://www.facebook.com/groups/cofacts/
2. Start a new thread, with the link to your unsolved Cofacts request, describe the difficulties you’ve encountered. (e.g. “The information looks absurd but I can’t find any reliable source to prove it wrong.” Or “I’ve found two side of stories opposing to the original information, I can’t decide which one is more accurate.”)
3. Many well-known editors may answer to your call and help you with finding the truth. Please collect the information and make them useful by reorganizing them and put them as response to the original request post.

### Situation 6: Other
- If you make any mistake, you can delete the responses you’ve made at any time. Just delete it and rewrite it.
- If you have any suggestions to our service or you need a function which doesn’t exist yet. Please post them on **Cofacts editors’ Facebook group**, our support will take them into account to optimize the system in future patches.
- Cofacts LINE users will not have the information of the editor who respond to their posts. All texts used in the response will be affected by CC0 and dedicated to the public domain by waiving all of the editor’s rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.


### Refer A Friend
- One of our long-term goals is to encourage more editors to join our project. We desperately need you and we hope you’d join us in the war of fighting misinformation. Help the ones who whenever sees a hoax and believe in it out of pure trust in humanity but is terrified with a little concern. Help us make this world a more trustworthy place to live in.
- Feel free to invite your brothers, sisters, friends, your loved ones, your crush, and thy neighbor to join and sign up as an editor. United we stand and in unity there is strength. You may be surprised by what we can achieve.
- By signing up to be one of the editors, now you’re helping numerous strangers in need with just your keyboard.
