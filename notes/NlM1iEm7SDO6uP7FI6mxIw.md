Like [SET@home](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) but run in browser, g0vhelper is a browser extension like newshelper and jobhelper for people to share their computing  resource and help g0v in [volunteer computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_computing) way.

## Why?


It  is a common need for g0v projects to have a backend to precook the data and run house keeping jobs periodically. However, operating a backend is not that easy for g0v folks to sustain. Most of the time people will donate some  computing resource from their own development server. But as people come and go, those backend jobs often stop without awareness.

Therefore, if nobody could run the backend jobs forever, ask nobody to run the jobs!!

## How?


Small job size
Each job should be small enough for running at background in nobody's browser.


## What?


### To nobody


Nobody like you and I could support g0v by installing this browser extension. At this phase, we could only donate our computing resource.

#### Opt-in share

Share computing resource to g0v projects optionally.
- Browser extension preference page
    - Select g0v projects
        - [ ] List available/joined g0v projects
> We could just mimic the design of Firefox 
> [name=Jeff H]

            - [ ] Sort joined g0v projects on top
> Should we have 2 different sections for showing available / joined projects?
> [name=Jeff H]

        - [ ] A "more" link to expand and show project descriptions

#### Gamification

We should encourage nobody when they contribute to g0v. There should be a page in browser preference showing how many jobs are done by nobody.
