#  Setting Up Distributed Tracing in Angular with Jaeger and OpenTelemetry
Monitoring performance over various services and identifying the bottlenecks in modern-day distributed systems is a challenging feat. However, distributed tracing solves the forwarding policies of requests through several services, simplifying the visualization and debugging of application profiling. For single-page applications (SPAs) such as Angular, in which the individual screen is constantly refreshed, distributed tracing is a prerequisite in helping analyze the effects of frontend interaction towards backend services. This guide will show you how to set up the tracing system in the Angular application through [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and implement distributed tracing as done in other systems. Upon completion, you will be proficient in tracing application interactions in [Angular](https://angular.dev/), including covering relevant spans and controlling the requests to the backend systems, which will be presented in Jaeger. Now let’s begin incorporating this fundamental toolkit into our Angular applications for greater insight!

## Prerequisites
Before we start with setting up distributed tracking with Angular, there are a few important tools and configurations that you need. First, make sure you have a rudimentary Angular application created; it will be easier to explain tracing because you already know how the structure of Angular works. You will also need to have Node.js and npm set up because they are required for working with libraries that manage the dependencies and run the [OpenTelemetry libraries](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/libraries/).

To gather and analyze the traces, we are going to use Jaeger, which is an open-source tool created for distributed tracing operations. You can choose to run Jaeger on your local machine through Docker for ease of installation or go for a hosted solution using the cloud-managed Jaeger instance. Finally, we are going to add some OpenTelemetry libraries meant to be used in Angular for tracing, instrumentation, and tapering of trace data to Jaeger. With these configurations applied, we are good to go with making changes to improve monitoring in your Angular application.

## Understanding Distributed Tracing in Frontend Applications
The process of distributed tracing is paramount when understanding the request flows in an application, especially in microservice architectures. With single-page applications (SPAs) such as Angular apps, where user navigations rely on app transitions, tracing extends beyond only the backend services and includes tracing user actions, providing a holistic view of how users interact with the entire system.

Relative to the front end, distributed tracing can help monitor events like clicking buttons, making an API call, changing navigation, or skipping pages altogether and assign these events to specific back-end services. For example, if an end user makes a request that is sent via the Angular application to a service, tracing will also track the request from the client side, which will be important when trying to diagnose performance degradation and/or failure in connecting both clients and servers.

As for the front-end, Angular now also has tracing capabilities because of tools availed by OpenTelemetry; therefore, an Angular application is ready to link user action or API invocation in Angular with the span, which in tracing indicates one of the activities in a trace. Each span contains information regarding the time an operation begins and ends, the operation’s particulars, and any errors that were encountered during the operation.

So, let's consider a very basic example of how to create a manual span in Angular when you want to make an HTTP request to the API.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { trace, context } from '@opentelemetry/api';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  private tracer = trace.getTracer('angular-demo-app');

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  fetchData() {
    const span = this.tracer.startSpan('fetchData'); // Start a span for the HTTP request
    return this.http.get('/api/data').pipe(
      tap(() => span.end()), // End the span when the request completes
      catchError((error) => {
        span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR, message: error.message });
        span.end();
        throw error;
      })
    );
  }
}
```
In this case scenario, for every invocation of `fetchData`, a span named `fetchData` is created, which signifies when the HTTP call is made and when it is finished. In instances where an error happens, it will be captured within the span. This offers a detailed perspective on the interactions from the front end and their impact on the services at the back end. Equipped with this knowledge, let us now proceed to the steps in which we set up Jaeger and OpenTelemetry for achieved tracing implementation.

## Setting Up Jaeger
Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing system that is widely used to monitor and troubleshoot distributed applications. In this tutorial, we are going to use Jaeger to trace and analyze our Angular application. You can either install and enable Jaeger locally using a Docker container or use a cloud-based managed Jaeger.

To run Jaeger locally, you can execute Docker and a one-liner command. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14269:14269 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.22
```

This command launches Jaeger in an “all-in-one” mode, which contains all necessary building blocks like the collector, the query service, and the interface with the user, simplifying the getting started stage. After the container is up and running, one can access the Jaeger UI by simply opening the browser and typing in the URL http://localhost:16686. The UI allows performing trace queries, trace ID filtering, and deep analysis of the spans.

To check that Jaeger is functioning as intended, one may examine the UI, which states that following the start of the trace dispatching application side, there is a section that contains several traces, the last few ones, sent by the client application. Further on, we will adjust OpenTelemetry in Angular to forward traces’ data to Jaeger, thus allowing for the end-to-end visibility of the whole application, frontend and backend communications included.

## 5. Integrating OpenTelemetry in Angular
To capture and export traces from your Angular application, it is necessary to implement OpenTelemetry. This includes installing the following open telemetry packages in the former scenario along with configurations to ensure traces are sent and stored in Jaeger with their automatic instrumentation for typical actions like HTTP requests.

First, add to the dependencies of your Angular app the OpenTelemetry libraries:

```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-web @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http
```

Now that you’ve included these packages, you can use OpenTelemetry to enable tracing in your application at the very beginning of its execution. Here’s an example of how to perform this operation in the primary Angular module.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { trace, context } from '@opentelemetry/api';
import { WebTracerProvider } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web';
import { registerInstrumentations } from '@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-web';
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor() {
    const provider = new WebTracerProvider();
    const exporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({
      url: 'http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans' // Endpoint for Jaeger or another collector
    });

    provider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter));
    provider.register();

    registerInstrumentations({
      tracerProvider: provider,
      instrumentations: [
        new HttpClientInstrumentation(), // Automatically instruments Angular HTTP client requests
      ],
    });
  }
}
```

In this configuration, we create `WebTracerProvider` and include `OTLPTraceExporter` sending spans to Jaeger along with `registerInstrumentations`, which help in the instrumentation of HTTP requests through Angular’s `HttpClient`, preventing any loss of traces. This captures every trace of each HTTP call, making it possible to visualize how the front end communicates with the back end.

By now we’ve learned that the OpenTelemetry starts with the Angular application, where the application sends traces via every HTTP call to Jaeger. In the subsequent sections, we’ll look at how it is possible to enhance the ability to trace the spans across the Angular application by adding individual spans and context propagation.

## Creating Custom Spans and Context Propagation
After successfully integrating OpenTelemetry, you can go a step further than just automatic instrumentation and add your own custom spans in order to monitor specific actions or user events in an Angular application. Custom spans give you more precision on what is traced since you can span some specific operations or code sections that are useful for performance evaluation.

To include a custom span, it’s possible to simply begin and end one manually within a particular section of code. For instance, if one needs to determine the duration of an internal operation inside a service method, the tracer can be used:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ExampleService {
  private tracer = trace.getTracer('angular-custom-tracer');

  performOperation() {
    const span = this.tracer.startSpan('performOperation'); // Start a custom span
    try {
      // Execute your operation here
      console.log('Performing an operation that we want to trace...');
    } finally {
      span.end(); // End the span once the operation is complete
    }
  }
}
```

Here, `performOperation` is the name of the span created just before the different operation is performed and closed immediately after that, thus holding the duration of the operation in Jaeger. This type of custom span helps you narrow down the tracing to areas of specific functions that are not automatically instrumented.

To make sure that a particular trace context is passed while moving from one different service or component to another (for example, calling a backend service from the front end), one can employ context propagation. OpenTelemetry takes care of this generally for HTTP requests; therefore, when an HTTP request goes out from your Angular application, the trace context gets passed inside the request headers. If you want to solve the problem of context propagation for the non-blocking operations in Angular, the context API of OpenTelemetry will allow you to do that:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { trace, context } from '@opentelemetry/api';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  private tracer = trace.getTracer('angular-data-service');

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  fetchData() {
    const span = this.tracer.startSpan('fetchData');
    return context.with(trace.setSpan(context.active(), span), () => {
      return this.http.get('/api/data').pipe(
        finalize(() => span.end())
      );
    });
  }
}
```

In this `fetchData` method, the custom span is associated with the HTTP request so that the trace context is sent to the backend, from where it is possible to link it with other services. This allows request flows to be visualized seamlessly between the frontend and backend services.

After configuring custom spans and context propagation, your Angular application already writes extensive traces, enabling deep analysis of individual interactions. In the following sections, we’ll examine how these traces can be tested to confirm their correctness in Jaeger.

## Testing and Verifying Traces in Jaeger
After you have completed the configuration of OpenTelemetry and configured Jaeger as the tracing destination, the next step is to ensure that the Angular application is generating and exporting traces. In other words, testing this feature means performing activities in the app that generate traces and looking at them in the Jaeger UI.

First, open your Angular application and carry out a couple of interactable actions of the user, such as pressing a few buttons or requesting data from a backend service, which will trigger HTTP requests. Each of these activities should be producing spans now from the additional mechanisms and its custom installation that you have incorporated.

After that, using your preferred browser, go to http://localhost:16686. and access the Jaeger UI. In the Jaeger UI, choose your Angular application from the services menu, which should have been made available by the name you provided to OpenTelemetry (angular-demoon-app). After that, you can also look for some traces that were generated on your system not long ago. You should get a trace list that includes the traces for the UA actions you executed in the Angular application.

Select a certain trace so that you can see its characteristics. In the trace view, you will see the different spans that make up the operation, custom spans like fetchData or performOperation, and system-generated spans like HTTP request spans. Each span displays its duration together with its start time and any additional information; therefore, it would be straightforward to spot areas of latency or even where the bottleneck is in the trace.

In addition, if you do not see traces, be sure to check your OpenTelemetry configuration, that Jaeger is up and running, and whether the `OTLPTraceExporter` URL is specified correctly. After this point, traces will function as they should, and you will have a fully functional tracing system that covers your Angular application from beginning to end, tracking its performance and resolving any problems that may arise with it.

## Advanced Configuration and Optimizations
With fundamental tracing in place, the OpenTelemetry and Jaeger setup can be upgraded to manage traces more effectively, regulate the amount of information collected, and improve its operational capabilities. These are high-level configurations that assist in controlling the amount of traces that are collected and how they are exported in production situations, where it is highly desirable to minimize the negative effects caused by the system.

One important aspect of optimization relates to the sampling strategy. OpenTelemetry, by default, collects traces of all the actions taken within the application; however, this may cause excessive data generation in applications with high usage. To deal with this, you can use a sampling rate, which is the percentage of requests that should be traced. For instance, at a 10% sampling rate, every tenth request is captured, thereby minimizing the data sent to Jaeger while providing an adequate sample. To do this, parameters have to be changed for Sampler during the initialization of the tracer provider.

```typescript
import { ParentBasedSampler, TraceIdRatioBasedSampler } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base';

const provider = new WebTracerProvider({
  sampler: new ParentBasedSampler(new TraceIdRatioBasedSampler(0.1)) // 10% sampling rate
});
```
Another optimization is performed by imposing a limit on the number of spans sent to Jaeger, which minimizes the network overhead by sending trace information in bulk. This is done using OpenTelemetry’s `BatchSpanProcessor`, which allows spans to be collected in batches before being sent out, instead of each one being sent out in turn. To enable batching features, `SimpleSpanProcessor` has to be replaced with `BatchSpanProcessor`:

```typescript
import { BatchSpanProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base';

provider.addSpanProcessor(new BatchSpanProcessor(exporter, {
  maxQueueSize: 100,  // Maximum number of spans in a batch
  scheduledDelayMillis: 5000  // Send spans every 5 seconds
}));
```
Ultimately, it is possible to avoid exporting excessive trace data by avoiding low-priority spans or certain routes. This might be beneficial in case you have sections of your application that do not need tracing. For example, you can use your instrumentation configuration to define some conditional logic and not record certain spans.

With these optimizations in place, the tracing setup becomes more efficient and capable of coping with production traffic while lessening the effect on performance. These are various configurations that allow meaningful and useful traces to be collected within your Angular app without excessive strain on Jaeger or the application as a whole.

## Best Practices for Distributed Tracing in Angular
In deploying distributed tracing, one must also consider the necessity of planning in such a way that allows for the maximum amount or minimum amount of tracer performance degradation depending on the specific business goals. There are a few Angular application-related best practices that can be followed, which make sure that your traces are informative and don’t pose too much burden on the performance.

First, don’t strain the tracking by mapping every action and every route. As much as you would wish to trace anything and everything, concentrate on important user actions and relevant backend systems like major APIs or heavy-weight components. Too many traces may mean too much information, which is hard to draw insights from and expensive in Jaeger storage. Previous sections have pointed to the use of sampling as one of the solutions to the problem.

The other further best practices include the appropriate use of span names and attributes. For instance, avoid using `request` or `operation` as span names, which do not convey meaning. Instead, use span names that are meaningful and relate to specific actions, such as `fetchUserProfile` or `makeOrder`. Moreover, user-defined attributes such as user ID, route, or error code will also help in the improvement of the trace data, which will make it easier for users to solve problems when looking at spans in Jaeger.

When monitoring user behavior, be careful not to record any [personally identifiable information](https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii#:~:) (PII). It is recommended to use only non-sensitive data in span attributes so as not to infringe on data privacy laws. If PII must be used for debugging, it is advisable to append it to a secure logging solution as opposed to tracing.

Finally, pay attention and improve your tracking setup frequently. With the development of your application and the change in user behavior, change your spans, sampling rates, and instrumentation in order to revolve around the most important interactions and the performance you wish to measure. That way you will avoid excessive tracing in Angular and be able to get the required information without much performance and financial waste.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
When you integrate distributed tracing in Angular, there might be challenges that may lead to traces not being produced or exported correctly. Below are the possible problems as well as possible suggestions to help you fix them easily.

If you do not see traces in Jaeger, the first thing to do is check that the URL provided for the OTLPTraceExporter endpoint is correct and that Jaeger is already running and reachable. This can be tested by going on the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686, assuming the instance is running locally on this machine. Also, check things like policies and rules, such as firewall rules, so that OpenTelemetry in your Angular application is able to reach the Jaeger collector without issues.

In case the spans are not found or are incomplete, make sure that all the required libraries are installed and that the instrumentation registration also contains the services that are expected to be traced. For instance, when the tracing of HTTP requests is not carried out, make sure that the `HttpClientInstrumentation` has been properly registered and that the tracing of certain routes or services has not been turned off accidentally.

When including tracing features, sometimes issues with performance such as high latency or slow page load times are experienced, especially in situations where too many spans are created or traces are sent one after the other. Ensure that you use `BatchSpanProcessor` and not `SimpleSpanProcessor` in such cases since the former minimizes bandwidth usage by transmitting spans together in a single batch. Additionally, check your sampling rate to make sure that you are not running the risk of overloading the application with data that can compromise its performance.

Lastly, suppose there are problems with sending trace context (for instance, there are obvious gaps between spans shown in Jaeger). In that case, once again make sure to use OpenTelemetry’s context API so that there are no asynchronous processes—such as sending HTTP requests or observables—for which the context is not supplied or made available. Periodic checks and testing of the system can assist in achieving the required objectives, which are smooth and effective tracing of the relevant activities so that the Angular app does not fail to serve its purpose of monitoring and debugging due to a lack of useful data.

## Conclusion
Protocols like OpenTelemetry and distribution systems like Jaeger provide greatly enhanced visibility in Angular applications to measure performance, fix issues, and understand user behavior across front-end and back-end systems. You have created complete tracing following this guide with the focus on minimization of resources used, and best practices for collecting the data have been implemented. Now with these components, your Angular application for performance measurement is ready, hence making it easier to keep the user experience intact and responsive.
