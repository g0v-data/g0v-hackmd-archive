## Saturday morning


[#cbc2015](https://g0v.hackpad.tw/ep/search/?q=%23cbc2015&via=0.tc0noszno3vuby7chp0j54s4i)

_(confidential, probably shouldn't take notes :)_
### Hope institute

Won-jae Lee \- works with citizens and city governments doing policy development for one of the candidates in general election 2012

When we're talking about software platform for connecting people, are they citizens with greed, or citizens with common cause? How will the platform encourage common cause rather than greed?

"we need good citizen rather than good platform"

Once we have citizens with common cause, and good democratic platforms for discussion, then there is space for lots of different political opinions to coexist.

### Snail Union

Housing cooperative for youth. Honorary youth mayor in Seoul.

From yesterday's discussion: we were talking about platforms a lot but not so much about shared experiences, interests, goals, which is essential for creating a "new citizen."

The main disagreements in Korean society right now could be summarised as: nationalisation of history curriculum, (something), and the water cannon incident. Huge discourses underway - could this be a transformative moment for new citizens?

My experience has been organising a youth parliament in Korea, like the youth parliament in Europe. Gathered 300 ordinary youth that wouldn't normally be interested in politics, split them into 13 groups, and had them focus on issues that they care most about, e.g housing, education etc. In June they will bring 10 issues to the Mayor.

We drafted a comprehensive youth plan in November, canvassing opinions from ~800 young people: what do you want from society? We did frequency analysis and the most popular keywords: respect, connection, trust, leisure, jobs-that-you-want-to-do.

There's a ministry for jobs, but they aren't interested in the kinds of jobs that people actually want to do. Rather than focussing on numerical targets, we should focus on the qualitative: what do people actually want?

The feedback we got from the officials was that drafting something like this is like opium (breeding dependency), like a criminal activity. Without intending it, that is like a public admission that the officials think of the youth as second- or third-class citizens.

When you're trying to create a new citizenship, we should start with small, close problems, which will become a source of energy for further movement.

The online deliberation was very public, but the site went down part way through the process, and we didn't have the IT resources to repair it and extend it into e.g. a decision-making platform like in New Zealand or Spain.

E.g. employment benefits. Municipalities are focussed on increasing the _number_ of jobs in their region. That makes them very parochial in the way they develop their policy. Changing the framing: asking how people want to work, what they want to achieve, will result in a much different kind of policy.

Chipping away at these immediate direct problems, can lead to progress on a deeper paradigmatic shift.

Focussing on a shared interests, rather than majority-rules, in a process of deliberative or participatory democracy, could lead to a new conception of citizenship oriented to common good. The municipalities are different in their position on this, there is a gap between discourse and deliberation, between talk and action. There is interest from e.g. the mayors, but it is an unfamiliar way of doing politics for them, the existing systems and processes get in the way.

Many local governments are now experimenting with participatory budgeting.

_How accurately do these deliberations really represent the will of the people, how do you account for the hidden agendas some people or groups will bring? _

We've always grappled with that questions: can 300 people represent millions? We have to be careful with that question because it can be used to discourage participation. Aside from the sampling bias we might have, note that it is _connective representation:_ an extended deliberation over 10 months developing agendas. We start every session with 'we represent all minorities', which is an important starting point.

### Women in politics/ in WAGL


Sharing the [notes from yesterday's session "Women and Minorities in Politics"](http://beta.hackfoldr.org/cbc2015/0.laz2quv68p2la8yub095m6lxr). Note that all the participants in that session were women. Why would there be no men? All the participants wanted to talk about other issues too, but chose to prioritise this conversation. How do we choose our priorities for which conversation is most important.

We need to feminise politics: adopting processes and approaches that work for all people, not just men.

Attitudes do change over time, e.g. Yago's experience: physics was a field for men, now it is more gender equal. But it doesn't happen "naturally", it happens by conscious, reflexive action.

Mentorship has a critical role to play in empowering women to step forward: she needs to know there is a network of support behind her, and that people believe in her. Even one comment can make a huge difference: "you could be a great leader, put yourself forward."

It is dangerous to think this stuff will fix itself overtime. It takes dramatic action. E.g. we see 'ironic sexism' in pop culture because there is an assumption that gender equality is already achieved.

Women need to step forward _and_ men need to step back. E.g. we can all _pay attention_ to who is taking up space in a conversation and moderate our own behaviour (there is even [an online clock](https://intertwinkles.org/clock/) for measuring this in meetings!)

We need to be conscious of gender bias in technology. The social dynamics of a group or community using  technology will be present or even amplified in the online space.

E.g. [Geert Lovinck](http://networkcultures.org/geert/) researching the role of culture in tech.

### UFO Factory

Social enterprise working for social enterprises. Have been working with media, schools, city governments, coming up with community platforms and idea platforms for them.

Have spent the last 3 years gauging the interest and needs in the market first. This year discovered this focus on politics + tech in media.

Current team is with parti.xyz - not coding anything yet, but grappling with the question of what is tech-enabled democracy, and if it possible, how do we globalise and localise it for Korea. (Pronounced like the french 'parti' not 'party'.)

Is grassroots democracy possible here? Is there a space for it? Is democracy efficient? Does it threaten the established hierarchy?

If you're income is not guaranteed, your participation is marginalised.

Short term view: slew of elections coming: General Election 2015, presidential election 2016, municipal elections 2017. Article 1 clause 2 of constitution: 'sovereignty of Republic of Korea comes from the people' - are you aware this clause changed at some point? Changed by former president in the 70's to add that the people exercise their soverignty through their elected representatives. Changed back to the original version in the 80's. Are we closer to the 70's version, or the 80's version?

Long term view: the constitution is 67 years old, in a 5000 year old context, this is a very fresh problem. Therefore the 3-year plan is to recognise that the power emanates from the people, and the people exercise that power, and to investigate how technology can enable that.

3 tactics: democratise how candidates are nominated within parties; changing the way legislation is developed; changing the enforcement decree after the law has been passed.

We already have many people already able to do this, but we haven't yet spoken with the majority of people who might support our initiative.

In this camp we can combine these three things: activism, technology, public.

It seems to be the next phase after rapid industrialisation, that we have an industrial democracy that needs to be upgraded to a modern participatory democracy.

There will be trials and errors. Expression leads to disruption.


## Saturday evening: how can we organise as an international network?

_What do Korean people need? What do international participants need? What can we offer? How can we share resources? Do you have any good examples of education programs, camps, etc, WAGL can learn from? Why is it useful for us to keep working together after this camp?_

### Organisational design support for WAGL

Inspired by Enspiral and LaboDemo.

LaboDemo only have 3 people, somehow managing a huge number of projects. Emphasis on connections: building bridges between organisations and tools. Looking for windows of possibility in different organisations. Mapping all the parties, institutions and connecting them.

How to organise WAGL team? Sharing documentation e.g. [Loomio's organisational wiki](https://github.com/loomio/loomio-org), [Enspiral's agreements wiki](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements)

Celebrating the success of this camp in our networks.


Offers:

- Media: many of us international people have good contacts with journalists that can help raise the media profile of WAGL internationally and in South Korea.
- Contacts, experts
- Camps & events
- Case studies, connection with lived experiences, especially youth: there are many inspiring youth groups in Spain. E.g. showing a film, or bringing people
- Development of open source - e.g. [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/doing-more-together-together-seeding-a-collaborative-technology-alliance-82243ea30d41)
- Collaborative projects, e.g. Loomio people can offer support for any deliberative projects
- Funding: contacts, strategy
- Shared spaces: we have coworking spaces in Seoul (WAGL) and Wellington (Enspiral)

For next camp:
Many of the international people could have been better prepared, e.g. a package of resources.

Very valuable to keep having these sorts of collective experiences regularly. It builds a sense of shared identity for the participants and builds trust, which grows the readiness to collaborate.

Planning a further into the future will allow more people

Sending people from WAGL to international events, to learn how we do things differently: e.g. LaboDemo is planning an event in Madrid, Enspiral has regular events ([next one](http://retreat.enspiral.com/) is in the last week of January).

International people agree we are all happy to work a lot harder and you don't have to look after us so well!

Technology to improve elections, e.g. [Ask Away](https://askaway.co.nz), [Open North](http://www.opennorth.ca/)

Short survey after camp, e.g. 'what do you need? what can you offer?'

Maintaining connection after the camp

Mailing list; Facebook group; Loomio group; gitbooks (e.g. like the [Pol.is Docs](http://docs.pol.is/)); chat room; calendar; Trello

Can WAGL send us updates?

Need a contact person in each organisation
