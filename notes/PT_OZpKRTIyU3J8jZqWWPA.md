Notes from ael:
Challenges I read on Lebanon:
Sectarian factions => in protest youth collaborate across sectarian 
deliberation and online discussion platform: how to structure or organize the debate
Youth unemployment > 35% & economics crisis & youth migration to other countries
Protests against corruption in Oct. 2019
=> people from different backgrounds go on the streets 
=> share g0v community participation in protest and how to push open government process after the protest
=> how to build solutions with civil society and make government transparent
=> how to build meaningful changes
Explosion in August, 2020 => disaster response via civic tech
Colonialism influence and replying on international funding (CSO) => decolonize the tech
