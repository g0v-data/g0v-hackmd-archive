### Directions & transportation
#### From airport to venue:
- Public Transportation
    - Take Bus 800 from G/F Gate 5, get off at 국세공무원교육원 공무원연금공단(혁신도시) (Government Employees Pension Service).
    - Bus comes every 15-20mins between 6:00 - 22:00
    - Total journey takes 1hr 10mins
- Rent a Car
    - recommended! [name=ohyeon]
    - Note: It seems that they have made it more difficult for foreigners to rent a car in Jeju. Many rental companies require you to speak Korean, be registered in Korea, or only allow foreigners to be registered as the secondary driver (with a Korean person registered as primary driver). Need to check in advance if you can rent as a foreigner - if they do, it seems they require an 'International Driving Permit' (which is different from an International Drivers License - though they say an International Drivers License from Macao and Hong Kong is allowed)
    - Q: Can TW ppl drive in Jeju?
        - Before pandemic cannot drive in KR [name=isabel]
        - TW-KR memo in 2022 [name=isabel]

## 2019/12/22 Organizers Meeting at FtO Tainan 2019
* Location: Jeju it is
* Date: end of April or start of May
    * Some dates to avoid (civic tech conferences in [2020](https://g0v.hackmd.io/4qcnxbsYSdqHYpifHb-Vng)):
        * April 20-24 is Internet Freedom Festival
        * April 23-24 is Personal Democracy Forum CEE
* We will work together on this.
* Some major tasks
    * Find venue and exact dates
    * Accommodations
    * Find local communities
    * Transportations
        * Check if foreigners can drive there.
    * Hangout every month
        * ** 1st in late January 23rd 8pm JP/KR 7pm TW ([Google Hangout](https://meet.google.com/hyz-bejj-neb))**
    * Visit Jeju in March???
    * Maybe a [OneButton](https://github.com/g0v/OneButton) for FtO

## OneButton FtO
* There is a [fork](https://github.com/g0v/fto-onebutton) from g0v jothon OneButton now.
    * [Hackfoldr template](https://ethercalc.org/fto-onebutton) ([result](https://beta.hackfoldr.org/g0v-hackath37n))
    * [Hackathon sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l02S2rRpcOuMX0Y6MInWKnjcLD0xU0-ivk58SOFKj2M/edit?usp=sharing)
* We did a few things differently in the past FtOs.
    * We use info sheets like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14y6K737zTnMqkOmTECmXjWYkEHFWtu6u0wCfXwtRUCc/edit#gid=880205619) on Google Spreadsheet.
    * We use a [Hackmd book](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@pm5/rJriRnlqE/https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1W7m11EOosq2n-gc0w4SBht2CuwoYr5L6ZbuBaKyZ2RA%2Fedit%23gid%3D1?type=book) instead of Hackfoldr.  Hackmd does not have an API.
    * Organising works happen on Hackmd docs like [this](https://g0v.hackmd.io/O-Yj2fBPREefIHQFOEyfYQ).
    * We use Google Forms to do [early survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XiBdBgFENjIh26M1B6MwqdGmez2oYBKz2E_0ifnIy8Q/edit) and [registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1955ZpUBPieR3GZ4azSLzqH4O5_qR5wh1cfRXvFzQBqA/edit).
