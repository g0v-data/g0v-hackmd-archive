There is no longer a need for manual interference to shift a car into higher gears because technology has advanced so much in recent years. The advent of the automatic transmission has made driving today more convenient.

However, new technology has its own set of problems. Since the traditional transmission system does have issues but automatic transmission system needs much more attention as well as care. A complete automatic transmission replacement is way more costly as compare to an engine.

This makes it crucial that you pay attention to the symptoms and issues of an automatic transmission if you want to avoid needing to make a significant repair.

## Reduced Level of the Transmission Fluid

Unlike traditional transmission, the automatic transmission relies on the transmission fluid. A transmission fluid is not just providing the lubrication but it plays an important role in hydraulic pressure that manages the automatic gear shifting.

Without sufficient transmission fluid, an automatic transmission cannot function properly. That fluid also needs to be of a high enough standard.

Additionally, there may be instances where fluid levels are adequate but the quality is subpar. It indicates that the fluid has degraded over time; however, high-quality fuel has a reddish tint. The transmission fluid is no longer in good condition and/or there are other issues with it if there is an unpleasant odour or discoloration.

However, the majority of automakers claim that fluid replacement is not necessary for the duration of a vehicle's life. This is a myth, though, as the oil eventually deteriorates and needs to be replaced.

Additionally, you must get transmission oil filter services to ensure that the transmission filter is in good working order and is able to deliver the correct and clean fluid when needed.

## Gears Shakes and Grinds

In normal conditions, an automatic transmission provides a seamless experience during gear shifting.
There should not be any signs of grinding and shaking sensations as your car switches gears. When a transmission is starting to have problems, these symptoms can seem insignificant.

This is a hint of the birth of an issue inside your transmission system and needs immediate attention. Usually automatic transmissions develop the gear problems and it gradually develops until you start to hear those noises.

## Gear Starts To Slip

Sometimes, automatic transmission starts to develop gear slippage. The transmission usually starts to lose the grip over the gears and they slip from one spot to other.

However, such a problem is considered as dangerous as it might put you in horrible condition while driving. Slipping transmissions always turn into a problem especially during acceleration.

However, the transmission fluid turns out to be the main culprit behind such an issue. But, there are broken transmission bands, clutches, or gears to blame.

## An Unusual Smell and Noise

Once there is a problem with your vehicle's transmission, sounds like whining, humming, or clunking begin to appear.
Your automatic transmission fluid degrading may be the cause of some noises coming from your transmission. This fluid has the difficult task of lubricating a staggering number of mechanical gears and parts.

In addition, strange smells begin to emerge if a transmission issue exists underneath the hood.

Overheated fluid is one of the most frequent causes of a burning smell coming from the transmission. The fluid in your transmission is crucial to keeping this expensive and complex system functioning properly. 

## Illumination of Check Engine Light

Your car’s check engine light is here to assist you if there is any issue. An automatic transmission is equipped with a number of sensors to sense any abnormalities during a drive. These sensors intimate your car’s computer so that it can turn the check engine light on.

However, the check engine light may turn on due to another underlying issue. But, an illuminating check engine light with some other symptoms such as noise and smell indicates an issue with your car’s transmission.

However, it is worth opting for car scanning and diagnostics at a reliable service centre to learn about the problem properly. A premature issue would be easy to tackle rather than going for a complete replacement of the transmission.
A well maintained vehicle requires you to arrange an assessment during routine car maintenance so that you do not experience any failures on the road.

Transmission issues typically offer early cues so that you can act appropriately and promptly. However, ignorance can often turn into a costly situation once a problem progresses to the point where it requires a complete replacement rather than simple car transmission repair.
