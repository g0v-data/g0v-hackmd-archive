The RadicalxChange Swiss chapter is thrilled this month to host a discussion of digital democracy in Taiwan. Yun Chen and Mei-Chun Lee will join us online from Taipei to discuss g0v (pronounced gov zero), the movement which has helped make Taiwan a world leader and important source of inspiration in the areas of digital democracy, civic technologies and transparent governance. The Meetup will take place online this Thursday, March 31 at 12:30 CET. All are welcome.

For anyone interested in the use of technology to help reinvent and revitalise democracy, this will be a fantastic opportunity to hear from and interact with two people with firsthand experience in what is probably todayâ€™s most important laboratories for new forms of participatory governance.
