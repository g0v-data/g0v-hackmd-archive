How do you decide when to hedge a bet?

Hedging a bet usually comes down to balancing risk and potential profit. I don’t do it on every wager, but if a game suddenly swings unexpectedly or injuries happen, I consider it. Watching live stats and checking odds movement helps me decide quickly. I also test small hedges when trying new strategies, and using sites like [1xbet bonus code](https://1x-bet-cameroun.com/bonus) lets me explore different options without overcommitting. Over time, you start to see patterns and can make smarter hedging decisions without feeling forced every time.
