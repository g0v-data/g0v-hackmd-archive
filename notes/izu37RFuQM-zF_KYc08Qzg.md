# Vaxx.tw Project 1.0: Mission Statement and Working Groups

## Mission:
To give everyone in Taiwan the information they need to get vaccinated against COVID-19. 

## What are the goals of the vaxx.tw website? 
### Everyone in Taiwan can get available appointments in seconds
* When on vaxx.tw, everyone should be able to understand which hospitals have available appointments. 
* This means building a website that is accessible and one that is available in all languages spoken in Taiwan. 
* If we cannot provide ways for users to sign-up, we provide them instructions or advice on how to navigate the sign-up processes of various hospitals. 

### Everyone in Taiwan knows if they can get vaccinated
The CDC currently only publishes rules for who can get vaccinated in formal Mandarin. This makes it hard for some people to understand including:

* Native Mandarin speakers with lower levels of educational attainment
* Immigrants to Taiwan who are non-native Mandarin speakers

### Important Note:
We are all volunteers. If the government can come up with a website that addresses all of these concerns, this project will have succeeded. Our goal as civic hackers is to help the public have access to these tools. We do not have to be the ones doing this. 

## Workstreams
vaxx.tw is divided into three workstreams. 

### Workstream 1: Content Accessibility
Desired: Translators and writers (A little coding work)

This workstream owns: 

* Translating the vaccine criteria by the CDC into plain language Mandarin and other languages.

* [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) from the United States Government
