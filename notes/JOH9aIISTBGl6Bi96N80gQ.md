#  Who is the Digital Democracy Team (TW)
The Digital Democracy Team is a working group formed by contributors from Taiwanâ€™s civic tech community "[g0v](https://g0v.tw/intl/en/)" (gov-zero) together with diverse partners committed to open source, open data, and open government.
Besides core contributors from g0v, the Digital Democracy Team is supported by Wikimedia Taiwan, which sustains our operations, and works closely with advisors from journalism, open technology organizations, and civil society groups that monitor city councils and advocate for transparency.
Bringing these communities together, the Digital Democracy Team acts as a collaborative hub to advance civic technology and strengthen **democratic participation in Taiwan and across the region, especially East Asia.**
