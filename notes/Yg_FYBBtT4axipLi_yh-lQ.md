Interview on Digital G0vernance

Hello all,
As a French student in a double master on Political and Digital sciences, I have been fascinated for several years by Taiwanese democracy, and in particular by its (innovative) digital tools.
I am currently writing a memoire note to better understand how digital technology contributes to the improvement of Taiwanese democracy, taking the example of the management of the Covid-19 pandemic.
To do this, I would like to conduct an interview with Hacktivists like you, involved in collaborative platforms, to ask you some questions.
Thanks for your help, 
Best,
Nicolas


# Taiwanese Democracy

-	What do you think of Taiwanese democracy ? Would you consider it as participative ?


-	Why are you so much involved in the development of Taiwan’s democracy ? Do you consider yourself as a politically active citizen ?


# Covid response :
-	How do you evaluate the government's management of Covid (speed, efficiency...) ?


-	How do you evaluate the civil society’s management of Covid (speed, efficiency...) ?


- How civil society and government interacted to bring the fastest and most efficient response ?



# Covid digital governance :
-	Do you think that the digital tools implemented during the pandemic helped contain the Covid-19 ? 


-	In what type of activity were you active ? What initiatives have you launched ?


# Digital governance :

-	Is nowadays the digital field vital for a democracy ? What does digital bring to Taiwan’s democracy ?


- Do you believe that the core values of the digital world (transparency, openness, ethics) is essential in politics ?


-	Is this political model an ideal for a developer ? 


-	Would you currently consider digital governance as well established in the Taiwanese governance or would you consider the field still has a lot of way to pursue?
