Been running ads for a few months and realized I was looking at the wrong numbers. ROAS only counts ad spend versus revenue but ROI includes all your costs like software and everything else. Your ads can look profitable with good ROAS but you might still lose money when you add up everything. Saw this thing about [roas vs roi](https://www.redtrack.io/blog/roas-vs-roi/) that explained the difference better. Now I check both metrics because they show different parts of the picture. One tells you if the ads work and the other tells you if you're actually making profit after all expenses
