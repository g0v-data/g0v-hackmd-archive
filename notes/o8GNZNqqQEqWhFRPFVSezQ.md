## Ensuring Smooth Performance of Firework Animations
If you want to keep the firework animations running smoothly, these are the tips to follow;

### Efficient Rendering
To ensure that the fireworks library or custom animation logic uses `requestAnimationFrame``requestAnimationFrame` for animations, this method provides smoother and more efficient rendering by syncing them with the browser’s refresh rate. Set off with particles and explosions in order to make the video look better taking into account quality and frame rate. Particle numbers will make your computer slow. Low-end devices with few resources will not cope with many particles and therefore may have low frame rates.

### Optimize Component Updates
Make sure the Firework component as well as parent components should not be rendering unnecessarily; to avoid re-examination of props or state utilize `React.memo` or `PureComponent`. If you are planning on creating something that’s always the same every time it happens – no changes whatsoever – always use fixed values or save all parameters concerning the fireworks beforehand to prevent re-calculation whenever they are shown.

### Efficient Memory Management
Make sure that firework animations are correctly cleaned up once the component unmounts so that there are no memory leaks happening during its lifetime. Usually, this is done by passing a cleanup function back from `useEffect` hook. To prevent garbage collection from taking too much time, avoid making new things inside looping animations – it will just increase memory consumption in your program.

### Handling Multiple Firework Effects Without Performance Degradation
Dealing with multiple fireworks at the same time, it is important to effectively regulate resources so as to prevent performance hitches. Here are a few tips:

* Group Effects: Think of combining fireworks in one canvas or DOM element if it’s possible to do that. This way, you won’t need to manage various elements at the same time, so it will work faster.
