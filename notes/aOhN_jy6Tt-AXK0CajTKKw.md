# How can we decolonise the internet together? Practical next steps

## Example: the Taiwanese language

The Chinese government forbade Taiwanese people from speaking their language, banning TV shows...  The Taiwanese intellectuals were also killed. The official language changed from Japanese to Chinese. The Taiwanese people (esp. in the North) are losing the ability to speak Taiwanese. The younger generation might not speak it because their parents were forbidden from speaking it. 

**=> Answer : creation of iTaigi, an online Taiwanese - Mandarin dictionary.** 
Some people speak leetspeak Taiwanese. 
Some people think there is nothing wrong with speaking Mandarin. 
The danger with dictionaries: thinking there is a correct way to speak Taiwanese. 

## Content / content moderation

### In some languages, there is very little content online, even by huge content providers (GAFAM). 
Example: Auditing Facebook's Terms of Services: Facebook has 20 million users in a certain country, and the terms of services are not available in that country. A translation of ToS is very cheap (200 dollars). The fact that FB is not doing it shows the arrogance of technical platforms. 

### Content moderation
Are the moderators native speakers? How do they decide if something violates the ToS? 
Can the AI understand the Myanmar languages, for example? Right now, content moderation is done through keywords, which can lead to erroneous deletions. _"Algorithms are not great on context"_ 

## Trying to advocate for a change in online platforms' behavior
Felipe has worked for a big tech company and tried to push for more languages on the platform. Pushback: _"If we do it for one language, we'll need to do it for all languages"_

Activists in non-WEIRD countries are reflecting on campaigning to impose legal obligations on platforms to translate their platforms for countries with more than a certain number of users, and even open offices in the countries so that they can be in contact with local government, societies, through the country's language(s).

## The problem of script
Some languages don't have a script

## Practical steps by the civil society? 
Ideas:
**Database of people willing to translate content?**
* In Taiwan, someone does international news in Taiwanese. There is also a Hakka channel. 
Different types of translation:
* Languages
* Tech people - civil society
* Majority - minorities. Ex: in Myanmar, a lot of Burma people don't embrace the country's diversity. 
* Ex : allowing minority languages to write in their script using Unicode. Unicode is how computers recognize languages, and is built to have a lot of fonts. Non-majority languages were not able to write in Unicode, and were usually in ASCII. The non-unicode systems are problematic because they don't allow for search and make machine processing difficult. 

> 1.Techies: allow for all languages to be written in Unicode. 

**Intersectionality**
> 2.Be aware that there are many layers of diversity in a country. _"We have an Asian on the team"_ doesn't cut it. 

## Use platforms like crowdin?
* Crowdin: https://crowdin.com/ (proprietary platform for translation between languages)
* Using Google Translate as a plugin? -yes, but how do we as a collective are going to create more content, and ideally more content than are translated. 

> 3.Archivists and librarians : select the documents that are to be archived. Also allows to build a corpus of documents that can then be used to train deep learning translating tools that need a lot of data to be fed. 

## Conclusion
Language is a really important entry point to the conversation of decolonization. 
Our communities can do things about it.
How, within our own contexts, can we think of repositories of good translatable material that can be part of a larger corpus of translations? 
If you want to be part of conversations around this, contact anasuya@whoseknowledge.org and we can create a space or a mailing list. 
Step 1 : V. could also include Taiwanese representation in the coalition of non-WEIRD countries auditing big tech companies.
