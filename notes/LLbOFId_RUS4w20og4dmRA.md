# 德國紀錄片 German Documentary

## 背景
- 4/16 收到德國紀錄片製作公司 PQP/P2 訪談的邀請，希望 vTaiwan 社群能夠一起聊聊如何運用 AI 促進民主與政治參與。
- 目前敲定在 5/8 進行討論，同時也希望取得之前審議會議的相關資訊。

- How do you use AI technology to enhance democratic processes?

- Which one of your 28 cases discussed through vTaiwan would be good to feature in our documentary? Do you have video material illustrating the cases that we could use in the  documentary?

- On your website you write: “The main approach employed in this project included the use of Pol.is for public deliberation and some initial attempts at integrating Large Language Models (LLMs).” How are large language models integrated?

- Which other AI tools besides Polis are you using effectively? Which tools should we take a look at? Is AI technology being used in these tools?

- How do you reach citizens? How can they find out about vTaiwan and what consultation processes they can take part in? Who is taking part, are all stakeholder groups represented?

- You are combining digital opinion polls with face-to-face discussions. How does this process work? Why are both digital polls and face-to-face communication important?
