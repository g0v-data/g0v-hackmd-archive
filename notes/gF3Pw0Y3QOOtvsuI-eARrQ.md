Questions for PDIS/MOHW about COVID-19 Vaccination

We are a group of civic hackers from g0v who have been working on a website to help people sign up for COVID-19 Vaccination Appointments. As the current wave of vaccinations are over, we would like to understand how we can help out with the next wave of appointments. 

1. How does one know if a hospital has available vaccinations? Currently, we are relying on websites to see if they have available spots. An example is [NTU Hospital](https://reg.ntuh.gov.tw/WebAdministration/VaccineRegPublic.aspx?Hosp=T4&RegionCode=). For each one of the many websites out there, we have to write code to import their data. This is proving to be difficult. 
2. Does PDIS/CECC have any plans to develop website availability as a function on these websites? If so, how will hospitals provide this data? 
3. Will Self-Paid Vaccinations return at a later date?
4. 民眾是否可以選擇施打疫苗的種類
