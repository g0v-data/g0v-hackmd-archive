Why Businesses Accept Cryptocurrency in Payments
Accepting Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies brings many benefits and opportunities despite the challenges. As customers’ payment habits are gradually changing, the emergence of blockchain has created incentives and favourable conditions for both businesses and consumers to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in payments. 
These benefits, including enhanced security, immediate transactions, anti-fraud protection, reduced transaction costs, reduced merchant fees, faster transactions, transparency, and innovative payment models, are the future of digital transactions.

Trends
According to McKinsey’s statistical report, due to the impact of COVID-19, payment trends have been constantly changing. 
For example, at the peak of the epidemic, the number of online consumption and purchases almost doubled, even tripled in some places, compared to the same period last year. 
Since then, several major changes have been made, and with the birth of Bitcoin in 2008, the appearance of e-wallets has become more convenient.
Today, using crypto in payment is no longer strange, but it still faces some legal barriers and is not accepted by the government in each country. 
These concerns come from the lack of regulations to govern the usage and application of cryptocurrency, potentially regarding taxes and how to manage taxes in each country and how to avoid anti-money laundering (AML) activities. This is urgent for local and international banks, who need to catch the trends and development of the economy.
