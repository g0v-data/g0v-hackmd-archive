When I started with affiliate marketing, my biggest mistake was not tracking properly. Now I use [capi integration](https://www.redtrack.io/solutions/e-commerce/conversion-api/) to accurately see what's working and what's not. This is especially important since all the iOS updates have made regular tracking less reliable. With server-side tracking, I can see the full customer journey - which traffic sources bring sales, which products convert best, and where people drop off. The dashboard shows me clear data without needing to be a tech expert. For beginners, my advice is simple: start with products you actually use and would recommend to friends, create helpful content around them, and make sure you can track your results
