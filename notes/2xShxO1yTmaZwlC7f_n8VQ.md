# 高雄美食地圖 for 面海松 Kaohsiung Foodie Map for FtO 2025 

## 發想 Idea 
- 去年 11 月去日本草津參與 Code for Japan Summit 的時候，主辦單位有提供一份在地社群建立的[草津當地美食地圖](https://armd-02.github.io/KusatsuJimoto2024/?#14/35.02258/135.96195/0/30)。因此想要在這一次面海松的時候也建立一個美食地圖，並附上翻譯，方便不同國家的人參考。
- When I attended the Code for Japan Summit in Kusatsu last November, the organizers provided a local food map created by the community. Inspired by that, we’re hoping to create a similar food map for this upcoming event at FtO, along with translations to make it accessible to participants from different countries.

- 覺得作為高雄人難得有公民科技的活動來到主場，當然要好好準備相關資訊！As someone from Kaohsiung, it’s a rare and exciting opportunity to have a civic tech event happening right here in my hometown — of course I want to make sure all the relevant information is well-prepared!
- 不同階段：
    - 第一步：先開共筆收集活動場地與交通地點附近的美食地圖 Step 1: Start a collaborative document to gather local food spots near the event venue and nearby transportation hubs.
        - 希望有店名、相關資訊、地址、地圖連結 Hopefully we can include the shop name, relevant details, address, and a map link.
    - 第二步：結合地圖資訊，讓參與者可以按圖聞香！Step 2: Integrate the information into a map so participants can follow their nose to the good food!
        - 除了共筆之外，思考看看是否有其他的資料收集方式 Besides the shared doc, let's brainstorm other possible ways to gather the data.
        - 剛剛找到 [name=chewei] 製作的 [google my map](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@chewei/B1h4U_9a5)，建置互動式的地圖清單！I just found the Google My Map created by Chewei — it’s an interactive map-based list!
    - 第三步：持續滾動式新增，歡迎大家常來高雄玩！Step 3: Keep updating the map continuously — and of course, everyone’s always welcome to visit Kaohsiung!
