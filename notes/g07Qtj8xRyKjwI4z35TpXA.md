# NDI: Looking for a consultant to setup INFO/tegrity workshops

NDI (National Democratic Institute, ndi.org) is looking for a consultant to setup — “a series of virtual workshops that would connect stakeholders from around the Asia Pacific region (and then eventually other regions as well) to leaders in Taiwan’s civic tech community to share tools, information and resources on information integrity.”

NDI（National Democratic Institute，ndi.org）正在徵求一位顧問，協助 NDI 籌組一系列「INFO/tegrity」工作坊，以串連亞太地區「實在資訊（information integrity，暫譯）」的利害關係人，以及台灣公民黑客社群的重要貢獻者，彼此分享工具、資訊及資源。
