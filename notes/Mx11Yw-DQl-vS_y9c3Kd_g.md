Hi Intel,

​

We'd like to design 2 display interface configurations in our mainboard :

​

1 . TCP0 for DP output with converter IC to VGA

2 . TCP3 for DP output with converter IC to HDMI

​

Currently we couldn't get signal output, could you please take a look for us, if our display setting is correct? (Our GOP and XML file as attachment)  

Thank you!

​
