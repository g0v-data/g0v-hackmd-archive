Built my first business website last year and choosing the right developer was harder than expected. Most companies sound identical when you read their websites. What helped was actually talking to them and seeing how they responded to questions. Found someone offering [website design and development services](https://www.shtudio.com.au/services/web-development/) who took time to understand what my business actually does instead of immediately pitching expensive features I didn't need. Their own site loaded fast and looked clean which showed they practice what they preach. Also checked reviews from real clients outside their testimonials page. Good developers explain things simply without making you feel stupid for not knowing technical terms. That communication style mattered just as much as their coding abilities
