Construction Elastomers Market is poised to reach USD 9.01 Billion by 2032, Increasing Demand in Residential and Civil Engineering Sectors. 

The [**Construction Elastomers Market**](https://www.snsinsider.com/reports/construction-elastomers-market-2368) size was valued at USD 5.47 Billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 9.01 Billion by 2032 and grow at a CAGR of 5.70% over the forecast period of 2024-2032.

The demand for the construction elastomers market is increasing due to the automotive industry's inclination towards lightweight and flexible materials. Thermoplastic elastomer is a popular construction elastomer as it is easy to use, design, and recycle. An estimated of 40% of the global consumption is used in vehicle manufacturing. With the growing electric vehicle market in China and the rise in the manufacture of automobiles over 94 million units globally by 2023, the demand for elastomers will surely increase. Not only do these elastomers add to the design flexibility, but they also enhance fuel efficiency and emission reduction. As the auto industry evolves, lightweight, versatile materials such as TPE will become essential.

These versatile elastomers are used in every part of the vehicle, and many can be recycled. Moreover, there is another lucrative opportunity as electric vehicles vie for noise-dampening and lightweight materials, as they require even more elastomers.
