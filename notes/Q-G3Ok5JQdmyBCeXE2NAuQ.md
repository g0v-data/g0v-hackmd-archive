Dear all,
Update the test TP results of V01A on CMW500 for your information.
UE support HSDPA category 14, as per specification, the DL maximum is specified to 21.1 Mbps.
In our test result, the average data rate is almost approached to the theory value no matter what the test method is performed. (Embedded/USB Tethering)
Therefore, V01A modem could transmit with the maximum data rate as per our results.
