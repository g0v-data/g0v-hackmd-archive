- 彬格萊對溫柔而美麗的珍妮深感著迷，伊莉莎白起初試圖與達西交談，但後者冷淡地拒絕了，她還無意中聽到他似乎在說自己的壞話，於是對他感到厭惡。

- 珍妮前往尼日斐花園拜訪時生病了，伊莉莎白於是前去陪伴，還與卡羅琳和達西發生了爭執。

Jenny was ill when visiting Netherfield, and Elizabeth went to accompany him.

Elizabeth
I'm so sorry. How is my sister?

You young ladies are so accomplished. 

男主
The word is applied too liberally. 
 
I do not know more than half a dozen women  that are truly accomplished. 
女主
Goodness, you must comprehend a great deal in the idea. 
男主
I do. 
She must have a knowledge of music,singing, drawing, dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word. 

And something in her air and manner of walking. 
And she must improve her mind by extensive reading. 

女主
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.

I wonder at you knowing any. 
 
I never saw such a woman.

She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold. 



- 科林斯先生很自負的牧師 對伊莉莎白展開追求。
I hope, my dear, 
you've ordered a good dinner today. 
 
I've reason to expect 
an addition to our family party.


 
His name's Mr Collins, 
the dreaded cousin. 
 
- Who is to inherit  everything. 
 
Even my piano stool 
belongs to Mr Collins. 
 
 
He may turn us out of the house 
as soon as he pleases. 
 
=== The estate passes directly to him and not to us poor females. ===
 

牧師
 
I'm honoured to have as my patroness 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh. 
 
You've heard of her, I presume? 
 
My small rectory abuts her estate, 
 
Rosings Park, 
and she often condescends 

to drive by my humble dwelling 
in her little phaeton and ponies. 
 
Her daughter, the heiress of Rosings 
and very extensive property. 
 
I've often observed to Lady Catherine 
 
that her daughter 
seemed born to be a duchess, 
 
for she has all the superior graces 
of elevated rank. 
 
女主
Do these attentions proceed 
from the impulse of the moment 
 
or are they 
the result of previous study? 
 牧師
They arise 
from what is passing at the time. 
 
And though I do sometimes amuse myself 
with arranging such little compliments, 
 
I always wish to give them 
as unstudied an air as possible. 

 女主
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect 
your manners to be rehearsed.

產生誤解
- 民兵到達當地，帥氣迷人的韋翰中尉（Lieutenant Wickham）立刻就引起了女孩們的興趣 他告訴伊莉莎白稱達西騙走了本應由自己繼承的財產  

女主

Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

中尉
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

女主
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

中尉
My father managed his estate.
We grew up together.
His father treated me like a second son,loved me like a son.

With his last breath, his father bequeathed me the rectory in his estate.

But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.


- 在尼日斐花園的一場舞會上，達西突然出現並邀請伊莉莎白共舞

男主
May I have the next dance,

Miss Elizabeth?

女主
You may.

bgm

女主
I love this dance.

男主
Indeed. Most invigorating.

- 她向自己最好的朋友夏洛特·盧卡斯（Charlotte Lucas）發誓，自己會永遠討厭這個男人。
- 兩人共舞時，伊莉莎白機智地挖苦達西，對方卻彬彬有禮地加以回應。
- 科林斯來到班內特家中向伊莉莎白求婚，但遭到了拒絕。

牧師
Dear Miss Elizabeth,My attentions have beentoo marked to be mistaken.

Almost as soon as I entered the house,I singled you out as the companion of my future life.

My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one from among Mr Bennet's daughters,for I am to inherit the estate and such an alliance will surely suit everyone.

Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve when I speak to her of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities.


女主
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but I regret that I must decline it.

牧師

I flatter myself that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy.

Besides, despite manifold attractions,it is by no means certain another offer of marriage will ever be made to you.

I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.

女主

I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man.
Please understand me, I cannot accept you.

mom 

Tell her you insist they marry.You will have this house and save your sisters from destitution.
Go and say you've changed your mind.
Think of your family.

女主
You cannot make me.

dad 
From this day onward, you must be

a stranger to one of your parents.

Your mother will never see you again

if you do not marry Mr Collins,
               
and I will never see you again

if you do.

女主
Thank you, Papa.

- 彬格萊突然返回了倫敦，珍妮對此非常難過，伊莉莎白於是送她進城去與叔叔和嬸嬸加德納夫婦同住，希望能幫助珍妮重新聯繫上彬格萊。
- 菲茨威廉上校無意中讓伊莉莎白得知，是達西令珍妮和彬格萊分隔兩地。


威廉上校
He recently came to the
rescue of one of his friends.
女主
What happened?
上校
He saved Charles Bingley
from an imprudent marriage.

女主
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

上校
I think it was her family

that was considered unsuitable.

女主
So he separated them?
上校
I believe so. I know nothing else.
- 達西表示自己一直以為珍妮並不愛彬格萊，最後生氣而又傷心地離開。
男主
Miss Elizabeth.
                 

I have struggled in vain

and can bear it no longer.



   

                   

These past months have been a torment.

I came to Rosings only to see you.



   

                   

I have fought against

judgement, my family's expectation,
                
the inferiority of your birth,

my rank.

                

I will put them aside

and ask you to end my agony.
I love you.
Most ardently.
Please do me the honour

of accepting my hand.

女主
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through,
                  

and I am very sorry

to have caused you pain.


It was unconsciously done.

男主
Are you rejecting me?

女主
I'm sure the feelings which hindered

your regard will help you overcome it.

男主
Might I ask why with so little civility

I am thus repulsed?

女主
Do you think anything might tempt me

to accept the man who has ruined
                

the happiness of a most beloved sister?

男主
I believed your sister

indifferent to him.
I realised his attachment

was deeper than hers.
Bingley was persuaded

she didn't feel strongly.
男主

I suppose his fortune

had some bearing?
女主
Our want of connection?
男主
The lack of propriety shown by your

mother, younger sisters and your father.

女主
And what about Mr Wickham?
What excuse can you

give for your behaviour?

Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish

disdain for the feelings of others



   

                   

made me realise you were the last man

in the world I could ever marry.


-信
男主
I shall not renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you.
But if I may, I will address the two offences you have laid against me.
My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.
He left him a generous living.
But upon my father's death, Mr Wickham announced  he had no intention of taking orders.
He demanded the value of the living, which he'd gambled away within weeks.
He then wrote, demanding more money, which I refused.
After which, he severed all acquaintance.
He came back to see us last summer, and declared passionate love for my sister, whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.
She is to inherit .
When it was made clear he would never receive a penny of it, he disappeared.
I will not attempt to convey the depth of Georgiana's despair.
She was  15  years old.
As to the other matter, of your sister and Mr Bingley, though the motives which governed me may appear insufficient, they were in the service of a friend.
- ==韋翰是個賭徒，達西本為他安排了工作，但他想要的只是錢==
  - 信中還稱韋翰要求拿到更多的錢，遭到拒絕後還試圖和達西15歲的妹妹喬治安娜私奔，為了是得到她繼承的30000英鎊，並且在得知自己永遠都不可能得到這筆錢後又拋棄了她。

- 凱薩琳夫人意外來訪，堅持要求伊莉莎白承諾放棄達西，稱後者已與自己的女兒安妮訂婚
凱薩琳夫人
You can be at no loss

to understand why I am here.
A most alarming report

has reached me.

                   

That you intend to be united

with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

I know this to be a falsehood.

Though not wishing to injure him



   

                   

by supposing it possible, I instantly

set off to make my sentiments known.

女主
If you believed it impossible,

I wonder that you came so far.
Your coming will be a confirmation

if such a report exists.

凱薩琳夫人
Has it not been

industriously circulated by yourself?

Has my nephew

made you an offer of marriage?
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.

女主
If that is the case, you cannot suppose

he would make an offer to me.
凱薩琳夫人
Selfish girl. This union

has been planned since their infancy.

Do you think it can be prevented

by a woman of inferior birth whose own sister's elopement resulted

in a scandalously patched-up marriage



   

                   

only achieved

at the expense of your uncle.

Are the shades

of Pemberley to be thus polluted?
Will you promise never

to enter into such an engagement?

女主
I will not and I certainly never shall.



   

                   

You have insulted me

in every possible way
                 

and can now have

nothing further to say.

                  

I must ask you to leave immediately.
- 晚上也難以入眠，天剛亮就出門在曠野中散步。她遇到了因得知凱薩琳夫人舉動而同樣無法入眠的達西，後者承認自己仍然愛著她，伊莉莎白也接受了他的求婚。

女主
After what you've done for Lydia and, I suspect, for Jane, it is I who should be making amends.


男主
Surely you must know it was all for you.

If your feelings are still what they
were last April, tell me so at once.


lf your feelings have changed I would have to tell you,
you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love you.
I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.
