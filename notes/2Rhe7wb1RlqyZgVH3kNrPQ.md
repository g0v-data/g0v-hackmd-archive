I launched a mobile game about six months ago and had no idea how different it is from regular games. The screen size and touch controls change everything. I tried doing some parts myself but realized pretty quickly that [mobile game development](https://kevurugames.com/game-development/mobile-game-development-services/) needs specific knowledge about optimization and different devices. Ended up getting help and they handled all the technical requirements. They tested it on various phones to make sure performance was good everywhere. The file size stayed reasonable too which matters for downloads. Game runs without draining battery like crazy. Probably saved myself months of frustration trying to figure out mobile-specific problems alone
