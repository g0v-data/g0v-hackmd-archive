I go through coils pretty fast with my Utillian 5 so I always keep extras around. The titanium ones last longer than the regular coils in my experience. They heat up nice and even too which gives better flavor. I usually replace mine every couple weeks depending on how much I use it. The triple coil setup gives good vapor production but they do burn out eventually like any coil. I stock up when I find good deals [Here is the link](https://hazesmokeshop.com/product/utillian-5-triple-titanium-coils) to the ones I use. Way cheaper than buying them one at a time and you never get stuck without a working coil when one dies
