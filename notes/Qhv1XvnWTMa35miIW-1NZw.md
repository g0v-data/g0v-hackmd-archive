Started betting on sports around October last year. Right now I'm using https://1xbet.com/en/ for most of my bets and it's been pretty solid. They cover a lot of different matches - premier league, la liga, champions league, plus other sports like hockey and mma if that's your thing. The mobile version works without issues which matters cause I'm barely ever on my laptop. You can do live betting too if you want to place bets while watching games. Cashouts are straightforward and usually process within a few days depending on your payment method
