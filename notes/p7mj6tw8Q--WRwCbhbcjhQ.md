# g0v-intl + Code for All

## Next meeting in June...

## 5/14 2300 meeting
* Everything is open by default. Private discussion only when someone asks for it.
* Super happy with the fast growth of the past 3 years since 2017.
* Context-switching is exhausting.  High-level strategy thinking and task forces are very different levels of work.

## Knowing where is what
* General information of CfAll https://trello.com/b/wHBbtpCS/code-for-all-onboarding
* Representatives do not have to make decisions; they facilitate communications between CfAll and their organization.
* ExCo is a bit decision making body, and also a big role as advicing.
* Code for All Projects https://trello.com/b/ThWkP3Vy/code-for-all-projects
* Code for All Trello https://trello.com/codeforall1
* Affiliates onboarding https://trello.com/b/9jOf8XOQ/affiliates-onboarding
* CfAll Representatives https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m3nN3ihTh_HQkHhL3Hb_4Fp_zEUsgUSVDazVQR2RdKQ/edit
* CfAll Dispatches https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=5fe264cee446e49a5c4de7db0&id=2ad13fafb8
* So basically, Slack & Trello & Loomio & Google Drive
* There is matterbridge, so if we need to connect CfAll Slack with g0v Slack just ask.

## Exchanges
* Translations of the works and projects of g0v, any list we have about them, would be valuable.  Please share them with K.
* Provide updates for monthly newsletter (every beginning of the month) -- collaborate [here](https://g0v.hackmd.io/3upGEp9LTICCEMhtYZJU0A)
* Explain & get feedback from other cfall members on community-based international affairs governance

## Information
* There is no legal entity as of now for CfAll.  There are just a loose set of guidelines.
* There are discussions about starting a legal entity, which might be helpful.  It is quite costly, though.  We decided that we will not do that until we have more momentum and members.
